## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to
uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to
[rdhpcs.help@noaa.gov](mailto:rdhpcs.help@noaa.gov).

## Quick Start Workflow

1. Create an issue that describes the change
2. Fork the project
3. Create a feature branch off an up-do-date `main` branch
4. Update and commit the changes
5. Push the commits to your fork
6. Submit a pull request to the `main` branch

## Issues

When contributing to this project, please first open an issue.  The issue title
should be short and descriptive.  The issue description should be clear and
concise.  Include enough information to help others reproduce the issue, or
understand the change requested.  Use [GitHub flavored
markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to format the
message, and include links to references.

## Pull Requests

Submit pull requests for bug fixes, improvements, or issues to particular
problems in the documentation.

Please keep the changes in a single pull to be as small as possible to help
reviewer(s) quickly evaluate changes.  If you do have a large update, try to
split the update into small, logical pull requests.

Please refer to the [Contributing to these
docs](https://noaa-rdhpcs.github.io/contributing/) to review how to build and
test the updates.  All pull requests must pass all build tests without warnings
or errors prior to being accepted.

Once a pull request is created, a member of the RDHPCS Documentation team will
review the changes, and, if necessary, will work with the author of the pull
request to modify their changes for correctness, and format.

[CODE_STYLE.md](CODE_STYLE.md).
