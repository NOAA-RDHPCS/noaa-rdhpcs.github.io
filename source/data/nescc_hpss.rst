NESCC HPSS
**********

The centralized, long-term data archive system at National Environmental
Security Computing Center (NESCC) is based on IBM's High Performance Storage
System (HPSS). The NESCC HPSS environment includes 22 petabytes of front-end
disk cache, five Oracle SL8500 enterprise tape libraries, three Spectra Logic
TFinity tape libraries, and 148 tape drives. Total available capacity is 430
PB. HPSS is accessible from WCOSS2, Hera, Niagara, Jet, and Gaea.

Users should keep the following things in mind when using the HPSS system:

-  The HPSS system is well suited for storing large volumes of data.
-  Users should avoid transferring many small files (in the megabyte range or
   smaller) to HPSS since the process of moving numerous individual small files
   to and from tape is inefficient. Please tar up small files into one large
   tar file before storing data into HPSS, or use HTAR.
-  All data stored in HPSS is single copy. Deleted data cannot be recovered.
-  HPSS is not accessible from compute nodes. Access is available via
   Hera/Niagara/Jet front-end nodes (FEs), Gaea Data Transfer Nodes (DTNâ€™s),
   and WCOSS2 transfer nodes.
-  Batch jobs that require access to HPSS should be submitted to the respective
   systems service or transfer queues.

For questions regarding the HPSS system, email rdhpcs.hpss.help@noaa.gov.

Gaining Access to use HPSS
==========================

.. _new_hpss_user_requests:

New HPSS User Requests
----------------------

Access to an HPSS project must be requested.  A HPSS user must be a current
user of a NOAA HPC compute resource (RDHPC or WCOSS) to have access to HPSS.
When you are a member of a project on a compute resource you are not
automatically added to the companion HPSS project (if there is one). Being
added to a HPSS project that you are already a member of on a NOAA compute
resource is done without PI or Portfolio Manager approval, but both are
notified that you are being added. If you are not a member of the project on a
NOAA compute resource then PI or Portfolio manager approval is required before
you will be added. To start the process please send an email to
rdhpcs.hpss.help@noaa.gov with the following subject line ``USERNAME requests
access to HPSS - PORTFOLIO/PROJECT``, replacing ``USERNAME`` and
``PORTFOLIO/PROJECT`` with your username and project request. If PI or
Portfolio Manager approval is required, the email should come from them.

All requests must have the following information:

-  User Name
-  Requested project(s) - See :ref:`NESCC HPSS Data Structure
   <nescc_hpss_data_structure>` for available HPSS projects
-  System HPSS access is needed from (Hera/Jet/Niagara/Gaea/WCOSS)

.. _adding_new_projects_to_hpss:

Adding New Projects to HPSS
---------------------------

Projects on a NOAA compute resource are not given access to the HPSS until
requested by the Portfolio Manager (PfM). The PfM also approves the maximum
time retention directory (pool) that a project is allowed to use on HPSS. All
lesser time pools will also be available. To add a project to the HPSS the
Portfolio Manager should submit a help request with the following information:

- Project name
- Associated users
- Maximum time retention pool

To remove a project from the HPSS the PfM should submit a help request with the
project name and data disposition directions. Requests are reviewed and
approved by the HPSS Resource Manager and sent to the HPSS system administrator
for implementation.

.. note::

   Requests for adding users and projects to HPSS is NOT supported in AIM, but
   instead the request/review/implementation/notification process is handled by
   the HPSS help ticket system.

   Email: rdhpcs.hpss.help@noaa.gov.

.. _nescc_hpss_data_structure:

NESCC HPSS Data Structure
=========================

HPSS data at NESCC is organized by portfolio, project and retention period,
with a directory structure of ``PORTFOLIO/PROJECT/RETENTION``.  Each retention
period (1-5 year & permanent) is set up as a separate file family, e.g.,
``1year``, ``2year``, ``3year``, ``4year``, ``5year``, and ``permanent``.  This
means that all data for a retention period is stored on the same tapes.
Projects live under the appropriate portfolio and have been assigned access to
specific retention directories.  Project users have access to write data to any
of their projects' retention directories.  Data within the same retention
directory can be moved to other projects within the same retention directory.
If data needs to be moved to another retention period (ex: ``/1year`` ->
``/2year``) it must be copied.

The structure has the following syntax:

.. code::

   /PORTFOLIO/PROJECT/RETENTION

Examples are:

.. code::

   /BMC/wrf-chem/2year

   /NCEPDEV/emc-meso/5year

.. note::

   Please be sure to store the data you write to HPSS in the appropriate
   retention directory, and in the correct project if you belong to multiple
   projects. This will avoid movement of data once it is stored on tape.

Portfolios Using HPSS
---------------------

Portfolios with projects currently storing data in HPSS are NCEPPROD,
NCEPDEV, BMC, HFIP, CPO, NAGAPE, NOS and SYSADMIN

.. _nescc_hpss_data_retention:

Data Retention
==============

Retention based storage is the HPSS archive policy in Fairmont, to better
manage data growth. Six retention storage pools (1-5year and permanent) were
created. Each retention period is setup as a separate file family. This means
all data for a retention period is stored on the same tapes. All HPSS projects
were then configured to write to one or more of these pools. Data in these
pools expires based upon the retention pool it was written in and would be
deleted upon expiration. All files in the HPSS archive have been assigned an
expiration date based on the file create time and the retention period it was
written to. Upon expiration files will be deleted from the HPSS archive.

.. _expired_data_deletion_process:

Expired Data Deletion Process
-----------------------------

.. _user_notification:

User Notification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Users will be notified of expired data via posted lists and email. These
notifications will take place on or before the first day of the month following
the dataâ€™s expiration. For example, data that has an expiration date between
October 1 and October 31 2016 will have its notification posted on or before
November 1, 2016. The expired file list is located on HPSS in
``/Expired_Data_Lists/expired.YYYY-MM.txt``. All HPSS users have read access to
this file and can retrieve it for review. The file is easily searchable by HPSS
username. For each file included in the expired list the file owner, file
group, filename/path, and expire date are shown. For example:

.. code::

   root system /1year/SYSADMIN/nesccmgmt/test_file-1G-11 Jul-6-2016.

Email notification will also be sent to all users who have data listed in this
file. It is the userâ€™s responsibility to regularly check the posted list for
expired files they own. Once deleted these files cannot be recovered.

.. _expired_data_deletions:

.. _file_size_guidelines:

File Size Guidelines
====================

Archiving files to HPSS is a much different process than writing files to disk
storage. Please be aware that the size of the files you write to HPSS can
impact the performance and efficiency of the system.

.. rubric:: Preferred file size range

File sizes in the gigabyte range are preferred for storing in HPSS. A few files
of hundreds of gigabytes each make the most efficient use of the system.

.. rubric:: Considerations for very large files

Transferring files that are 1 TB or larger increases the risk of poor system
performance as well as the risk (although small) of losing a file that contains
a large amount of data. We recommend storing files that are 1 TB or smaller.

.. rubric:: Avoid small files

Avoid transferring many small files â€” those in the megabyte range or smaller.
The process of moving numerous individual files to and from tape is
inefficient. It can become very time consuming and result in slowing the system
for all users.

When you need to store many small files, use one of these two approaches:

-  Use :ref:`htar <using-htar>` to transfer them together as a single archive
   file.
-  Use an archiving utility, e.g. ``tar``, on the source system to bundle the
   member files and then transfer the resulting archive file with ``hsi put``
   or or ``hsi cput``.

Please contact the HPSS helpdesk if you need help determining appropriate file
sizes for your specific workload.

.. _data_recovery_policy:

Data Recovery Policy
====================

Occasionally an archive tape is damaged or otherwise becomes partially
unreadable. When that happens, the local RDHPCS staff works with the
manufacturer to troubleshoot the problem and take steps to attempt to recover
the missing data. Very rarely, even with these efforts, we are unable to
recover the missing files. The user will then be informed of the files we
cannot recover.

In that case, the user has one further option. There are a number of outside
recovery services which will make further attempts at recovery for a fee. Some
charge a flat fee, some charge more if they are able to recover than if they
are unable to recover. If the user wishes to sign up for such a service and pay
the fee, RDHPCS will handle the logistics of shipping and other coordination
with the recovery service.

.. _nescc_hpss_getting_started:

Getting Started
===============

HPSS is only accessible from WCOSS, Theia, Jet and Gaea Remote Data Transfer
Nodes (RDTN). Modules have been created on each system to provide the proper
user environment and tools to access HPSS from these systems. These modules are
not loaded by default and will need to be loaded before you can use any of the
HPSS commands. To add the HPSS tools to your environment, use the following
module command:

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: Hera, Jet, Niagara, and WCOSS

      .. code::

         module load hpss

   .. tab-item:: On Gaea RDTN's

      .. code::

         module use /sw/rdtn/modulefiles
         module load hsi

.. _using-htar:

HTAR
----

HTAR allows the creation of archive files directly in HPSS without the need to
do an intermediate step of first creating the archive (tar) file on local disk
storage before copying the archive file to HPSS.  In addition, HTAR creates a
separate index file, which contains the names and locations of all of the
member files in the archive file. The index file allows individual files and
directories in the archive to be randomly retrieved without the need to read
through the archive file.

.. note:: Limitations

   HTAR has the following limitations:

      * File size: An individual file within the tar file may not be larger
        than 68 GB.
      * Directory paths: The directory path of any file may not exceed 154
        characters in length.
      * File names: File names may not exceed 99 characters in length.

.. _using-hsi:

HSI
---

HSI is an FTP-like interface to the HPSS.  HSI is most useful for file and
directory manipulation.  HSI supports wild cards for local and HPSS pathname
pattern matching, and provides recursion for many commands, including the
ability to store, retrieve, and list entire directory tress, or change
permissions on entire trees.  Some HSI operations, such as ``cp`` and ``mkdir``
resemble their Linux and UNIX counterparts.

For example:

-  ``hsi ls`` lists the contents of a directory
-  ``hsi cp`` copies files within the HPSS
-  ``hsi rm`` permanently removes a file
-  ``hsi mkdir`` creates a directory
-  ``hsi rmdir`` deletes a directory
-  ``hsi mv`` moves files within the HPSS directory structure

.. _hsi_basic_usage:

   [hpsscore1]/PORTFOLIO/foo-> put hpss_file

.. rubric:: Single line execution

Enclose the HSI opertaions in quotes, separated with the semicolon (;)
character.

.. code::

   hsi "mkdir foo; cd foo; put hpss_file"

.. rubric:: Using commands from a File

Use the HSI ``in`` operation to read HSI operations from a file

.. code::

   $ cat command_file
   mkdir foo
   cd foo
   put hpss_file
   $ hsi in command_file

.. rubric:: Using a Heredoc

Similar to using operations contained in a file, the shell's heredoc feature
can be used to pass to HSI the operations.  This method is useful in a batch
job script.

In this example, we get a file from HPSS, ``hpss_file``, and place it in a new
directory foo on the local system.

.. code::

   $ hsi <<EOF
      lmkdir foo
      lcd foo
      get local_file : hpss_file
   EOF

.. note::

   The HSI ``get`` and ``put`` operations use a different syntax than FTP to
   identify the local file name. The HSI syntax uses a ``:`` (colon character)
   to separate the local pathname from the HPSS pathname.

.. caution::

   The ``mv``, ``put``, and ``get`` HSI operations can overwrite data at their
   targets without warning.  This is a problem if you mistakenly remove or
   overwrite data, because it cannot be recovered. To help prevent inadvertently
   overwriting your HPSS files with these commands, establish directory
   permissions carefully.

   $ hsi mv /1year/PORTFOLIO/old/location /1year/PORTFOLIO/new/location

Please note that the ``mv`` operation will only work for files/directories
stored in the same retention directory. If you need to move data between
retention directories you must use cp. Please contact the HPSS helpdesk for
steps on doing this efficiently.

.. rubric:: Writing Files to HPSS

To put the file ``local_file`` into the HPSS directory
``/BMC/testproj/myid/work``

.. code::

   $ hsi put /full_local/path/local_file : /BMC/testproj/myid/work/local_file

.. rubric:: Retrieve a File from HPSS

In this example, we will To get the HPSS file ``hpss_file`` located in the HPSS
directory ``/BMC/testproj/myid/work``.

To place ``hpss_file`` in your current directory:

.. code::

   $ hsi get /BMC/testproj/myid/work/hpss_file

To place ``hpss_file`` in the local directory ``/full_local/path`` with the
name ``new_name``:

.. code::

   $ hsi get /full_local/path/new_name : /BMC/testproj/myid/work/hpss_file

.. rubric:: Retrieve a File from HPSS and Preserve the Modification Time

.. code::

   $ hsi get -p /BMC/testproj/myid/work/hpss_file

.. rubric:: Listing the Contents of an HPSS Directory

To list the contents of the directory /BMC/testproj

.. code::

   $ hsi ls /BMC/testproj

The ``ls`` operation has other useful options.  Using the ``-N`` option will
list fill file information, along with the full path to the file.

.. code::

   [core]/-> ls -N /BMC/testproj
   -rw-------    1 User.ID  grp      54727283200 Mar 20  2016 /BMC/testproj/hpss_file1.tar
   -rw-------    1 User.ID  grp             5408 Mar 20  2016 /BMC/testproj/hpss_file1.tar.idx
   -rw-------    1 User.ID  grp      54727283200 Mar 20  2016 /BMC/testproj/hpss_file2.tar
   -rw-------    1 User.ID  grp             5408 Mar 20  2016 /BMC/testproj/hpss_file2.tar.idx

The ``-V`` option will list the tape volume information for a file (PV List is
the tape volume):

::

   [core]/-> ls -V /BMC/testproj/hpss_file1.tar
   /BMC/testproj:
   -rw-------    1 User.ID  grp           5         1234 TAPE   54727283200 Mar 20  2016 hpss_file1.tar

.. _file_expiration_commands:

File Expiration Commands
------------------------

The HSI operations ``expls`` and ``expfind`` are used to show and find the
expiration date of data stored in HPSS.  Each operation has the ``-h`` option
to display the usage information.

.. rubric:: Operation expls Help

.. code::

   $ hsi "expls -h"
   Usage expls [-?] [-A] [-R] [-v] [path ...]
     -?  : display this usage
     -A  : display absolute pathnames
     -R  : [standard option]recursively list hash entries for files in the specified path(s)
     -v  : verbose listing mode

.. rubric:: Operatoin expfind Help

.. code::

   $ hsi "expfind -h"
   Usage: expfind[ete] [-?] [-A] [-b beginTime] [-d days] [-e endTime] [-R]  [path ...]
     -?  : display this usage
     -A  : display absolute pathname for files
     -b  : specify beginning time in range
     -d  : find file that will be expiring in specified number of days from today
     -e  : specify ending time in range
     -R  : [standard option]recursively delete expiration time for the specified path(s)
     Note: If -b is not specified, then files whose expiration time is <= endTime are listed
           If -e is not specified, then files whose expiration time is>= beginTime are listed
           If neither -b nor -e is specified, all expired files in the path(s) are listed
              based on the time at which the command is started
    Times are of the form YYYY-MM-DD[-hh:mm:ss]
    hours/mins/seconds are optional and default to 00:00:00 if not specified

Sample HPSS Batch Job
---------------------

The following is a sample script that shows how to transfer data to HPSS via a
batch job:

.. code::

   #!/bin/bash -l
   #SBATCH --ntasks=1
   #SBATCH --time=0:30:00
   #SBATCH --account=<project>
   #SBATCH --partition=service
   #SBATCH --job-name=hpss-test

   module load hpss

   set -x

   hpssdir=${hpssdir:-/1year/PORTFOLIO/project/User.Id}    # XXXX: Location of your file in HPSS
   tarfile=${tarfile:-hpss_file.tar}                       # XXXX: Name of the tar file in HPSS
   dirsave=${dirsave:-/path/to/save/directory}             # XXXX: Location of data you want to write to HPSS

   cd $SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR

   #   Check if the tarfile index exists.  If it does, assume that
   #   the data for the corresponding directory has already been
   #   tarred and saved.
   hsi "ls -l ${hpssdir}/${tarfile}.idx"
   tar_file_exists=$?
   if [ $tar_file_exists -eq 0 ]
   then
      echo "File $tarfile already saved."
      exit
   fi

   #   htar is used to create the archive, -P creates
   #   the directory path if it does not already exist,
   #   and an index file is also made.
   htar -P -cvf ${hpssdir}/$tarfile $dirsave
   err=$?
   if [ $err -ne 0 ]
   then
      echo "File $tarfile was not successfully created."
      exit 3
   fi

.. note::

   The HSMS is not an infinite resource. Quotas will be enabled over time to
   prevent uncontrolled use. Only save what you need to save. Consider the cost
   of time and compute resources to regenerate data from the original input
   files. That is often cheaper than storing the data long term.
