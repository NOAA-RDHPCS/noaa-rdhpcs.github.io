Overview
========


RDHPCS provides several methods to transfer data to and from RDHPCS
systems. Each method has  advantages and
disadvantages or limitations. Users should pick the approach that best
suits their needs based on the information provided here.

For security reasons, access to most external
hosts or sites (including your laptop/desktop) is blocked, and access is
opened up on an as-needed basis.  Sites that have been allowed access
are referred to as *trusted hosts* and all other sites/hosts will be
considered *"untrusted" sites/hosts.*

Please see the '''Firewall''' section below for more details if you
need access to/from a machine that is currently considered as an
“untrusted” host/site.

.. _data_transfer_methods:

Data Transfer Methods
=====================

* Globus Connect Service is a utility system, Web or CLI-based, for
  efficient data transfer between DTNs and external storage systems.
  Where Globus endpoints are available, it is the recommended method
  for high-speed transfer. Note that some sites outside the RDHPCS
  program do not support Globus.
* Data Transfer Nodes (DTNs) are dedicated systems
  deployed and configured specifically for data transfers, providing
  fast methods for data transfer.  DTNs
  can only be used within RDHPCS, and transfers are limited to
  High-Performance File Systems (HPFS).
* Untrusted Data Transfer Nodes (UDTNs). Nodes available from anywhere
  on the Internet, to support transfers in and out of the RDHPCS
  program to external sites. Globus, or typical data transfer
  commands, can be used for transfer to and from UDTNs.
* Port Tunnelling. SSH tunnels can be created from a point of login to
  any remote host. Once a tunnel has been created, you can use the
  tunnels for data transfers, even from “untrusted hosts". This
  method is available when other choices are not available or optimal.


.. _globus:

Globus
------

Globus Connect Service is available on all RDHPCS systems (Hera, Mercury, Jet,
PPAN, Gaea, Orion, and Hercules) and we encourage its use over other methods
whenever possible. Globus Connect Service is used to transfer data between
Globus endpoints. A Globus endpoint is a file transfer location
(computer/server) accessible to Globus. To transfer data, use your browser to
connect to the `Globus App`_, authenticate to each endpoint, then
navigate to the desired directory, select the
file(s)/directory(s) to be transferred, and initiate the transfer.  The
movement of data will be managed and supervised in the background. You may
close the browser or leave the browser open. The current status of your request
is displayed if you need it. When the transfer is complete, you will be
notified by email. Please see :ref:`globus_online_data_transfer`
for complete details.

Some use cases that involve sites outside the RDHPCS program may not
support Globus. In these cases, you can use the other methods
described below.

.. _DTNs:

Data Transfer Nodes (DTNs)
--------------------------

We highly recommend using this method to transfer data when available,
as it provides a fast method for transferring TO and FROM HPC Systems
- Jet, Hera, Mercury, Gaea, and Orion.  Please see the
Transferring Data page for complete details.

Note the following:

* DTNs can only be used **between NOAA RDHPCS systems.** For transfers
  involving systems outside the NOAA RDHPCS, see the UDTN section below.
* DTNs can typically only access the High-Performance Filesystems
  (HPFS-scratch file systems), not the **/home** filesystems.  This is a
  HPC site-specific configuration.
* Unattended data transfers can only be done using the DTNs.

If you are unable to use the DTNs, please review the other available options.

.. _UDTNs:

Untrusted Data Transfer Nodes (UDTNs)
-------------------------------------

Untrusted DTNs (UDTNs) are accessible from anywhere on the internet.
They are designed to allow data to be transferred in and out of the
RDHPCS program from external (non-NOAA HPC) sites -- Cloud
providers, Universities, for example. UDTNs only access the following
directories on the host system:

``/*/data_untrusted/$USER``

For occasional transfers to/from untrusted hosts, you can use two stage
copying to copy data from an remote host to an RDHPCS host.

* Untrusted DTNs can only be used for inbound connections.
  The connection cannot be started
  on the DTNs, but data can flow in either direction. Typically, users
  should be able to log in to the remote system and initiate a transfer
  from the remote machine.

.. note::

    Before you use the UDTN for data transfers, you MUST have logged
    into the appropriate host for the necessary directories to appear -
    including your /home.

    Please see the Transferring Data page
    for complete details.

.. _Port_Tunnelling:

Port Tunnelling
---------------

In the SSH port tunnel method, an SSH tunnel is created between your
point of login (typically your desktop) to the remote host (typically
Hera, Jet or other remote hosts). The port tunnel method works
from any system on the network (that is, your local machine does not
necessarily have to be in the noaa.gov domain). We recommend using
this method when the options above are not available or
are not optimal for your use case.  Please see the
Transferring Data page for complete details.

.. _requests_for_firewall_exceptions:

Requests for Firewall Exceptions
================================

For security reasons, access to/from all external sites is controlled
by a Firewall and most external sites are blocked and allowed to
connect only through an exception to the Firewall rules. Please see
the Transferring Data page for complete details.

.. _firewall_exception_terms:

Firewall Exception Terms
========================

* Data Transfer Method: scp, sftp, rsync, globus, wget, curl, "globus"
* Local Machine: Where you will be logged in when initiating the transfer
* Remote Machine: The other machine that will be involved in the transfer.

.. note::

    If you need to access an external site on a routine basis
    for your work, you will need to request a Firewall Exception. Submit a
    helpdesk ticket with the subject line: Firewall Exception request and
    provide the information requested below.

* Justification: Some information about why this is needed
* Data Transfer Method: The utility that will be used for doing data transfer
* Local Machine: DNS name, IP address (or endpoint for Globus)
* Remote Machine: DNS name, IP address (or endpoint for Globus)
* Sample command: A typical transfer command

.. note::
    If you have a globus endpoint, please provide it, as that would be the preferred method for data transfers.

.. note::
    Using Globus, you can have a third party transfer where both the ends of a transfer are remote.


.. _transferring-data:

Transferring Data
=================

Globus Connect Service (GCS) is now available on RDHPCS systems, and
we encourage its use over any other method whenever possible. Some use
cases that involve sites outside the RDHPCS program that may not
support Globus may still use other methods described in this document.

Many users are accustomed to using scp/sftp via service (same as
login) nodes. However, we would like to point out that Data Transfer
Nodes (DTN's) provides a much faster method for transferring data to
and from HPC systems (Jet/Ursa/Hera/Mercury/Gaea/WCOSS/Orion), so
we highly recommend DTNs over service nodes.

Much data on RDHPCS servers are protected by confidentiality
agreements, may be sensitive, or are otherwise proprietary. Our
obligation includes the enforcement of all policies that make curating
such data even possible. This involves maintaining tight security that
adheres to NOAA OCIO guidelines. We also recognize the need for
sharing data with collaborators who may not be vetted by us to ensure
that NOAA/DOC standards are met. The so-called untrusted DTN was
created so that less secure channels may be open for the smooth
transfer of data essential for projects to conduct their research.

The following section is common for most operating systems and
exceptions are noted.

Only the High-Performance Filesystems (the scratch filesystems) are
available, not your /home filesystem. When you are asked for a
password, provide your RSA Token's PIN + current 6 or 8 digit number
from your token (a.k.a Passcode).

All RDHPCS systems require an initial login before you can
access your directories from the DTNs/uDTNs.  This is
because the directory structure gets set up only on
the first login to login nodes on the host.


Globus Connect
==============

Details and examples are available in the
:ref:`globus_online_data_transfer` section.

.. _transferring-data-trusted-dtn:

Trusted Data Transfer Nodes (DTN)
=================================

By default, trusted Data Transfer Nodes are only accessible from some
hosts within noaa.gov (and Orion). If you need access
to/from a host that is not accessible, we will need to modify system
firewalls. See :ref:`firewall-modifications` for directions.

DTNs support ssh-based authentication transfer methods, which
currently include scp, rsync, and sftp. Default
authentication uses your RSA token.

.. note::
    If you're using WinSCP on Windows, choose SFTP as the protocol rather than SCP.

Untrusted Data Transfer Nodes (UDTN)
====================================

Untrusted DTNs (UDTNs) are open systems that are accessible from
anywhere, including your personal machine. It is possible to do data
transfers from most external sites including your local
desktop/laptop. However, note the following important points:

* Before you can use the UDTNs for data transfers on any of the
  clusters (Mercury, Ursa, Hera, Jet, PPAN, etc.), **you must login
  at least once to set up the necessary directories.**
* File space on the UDTNs is very limited. So it is important to move
  to your project space as soon as possible and clean up
  temporary files. Failure to comply with this policy will force us to
  remove your data and disable your access to this directory.
* You can use Globus Online Data Transfer to transfer data to/from the
  UDTNs. Details and examples are available in the
  :ref:`globus_online_data_transfer` section
* Using "globus flows" may be a good way to accomplish two-step
  transfers since most of the time the data has to be moved off of the
  destination!

.. note::
    If you're using WinSCP on Windows, choose SFTP as the protocol rather than SCP.

* Unattended data transfers are only allowed on the Trusted DTN's, and
  not allowed on any of the Untrusted DTNs.
* **All files under your allocated directories which have not been
  accessed in the last 5 days will be automatically purged!!!**
* You don't have access to all of the file systems on the respective
  systems. Instead, you are only able access the temporary directories
  specific to the system mentioned in the table below:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1

.. hint::

  **On Mercury and Ursa, the Directory on the host differs from the Directory as
  seen on the uDTN. The final column in the table above shows the data path on
  a DTN/uDTN, if it differs from the native path on the system.**

Please note that your project directories are not directly
accessible from some of the uDTNs, so a two-step transfer
is generally required to move data to/from project
directories.  The steps below show how to transfer
a file from a remote location to your project space on
the RDHPCS systems, and you do the steps in reverse order to
move the file in the opposite direction:

#. First transfer to the data_untrusted tree above using the uDTN
#. Then move/copy to the allocated project space.

The Globus Flows may be useful here in setting up automated 2-step
transfers.

Transfer and Syntax Examples
============================

.. Note::
    Username is case sensitive in the scp command. For example, the username should be in the
    form **First.Last**, rather than **first.last**.
    Replace dtn-<name>.<site>.rdhpcs.noaa.gov with the correct host name listed above.

.. code-block::

    scp /path/to/local/file First.Last@dtn-<name>.<site>.rdhpcs.noaa.gov:/path/on/HPC/System
    First.Last@dtn-<name>.<site>.rdhpcs.noaa.gov's password:

(This is the point where you enter your PIN+RSA Token response)

Transfer a file on Hera to a destination on Jet
-----------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: console

  [First.Last@hfe04 ~]$ scp /scratch3/SYSADMIN/nesccmgmt/
  First.Last/data_file First.Last@dtn-jet.boulder.rdhpcs.noaa.gov:/mnt/lfs5/SYSADMIN/jetmgmt/First.Last/
  Warning: Permanently added the RSA host key for IP address '140.208.168.55' to the list of known hosts.
  First.Last@dtn-jet.boulder.rdhpcs.noaa.gov's password:
  data_file                                                                  100%   30     0.3KB/s   00:00
  [First.Last@hfe04 First.Last]$

Globus transfer from an external endpoint to the GFDL untrusted endpoint
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This example transfers a file named 'myDataFileName_here.txt' from
'my-personal-endpoint-id' to the untrusted GFDL endpoint,
'6ba73d87-08f2-463e-bf8f-83cc3e7a871f'. The data string
'6ba73d87-08f2-463e-bf8f-83cc3e7a871f' is the actual Globus ID of the
GFDL untrusted endpoint.

To issue the command, replace First.Last in the example with your own
credentials.

.. code-block:: console

    [First.Last@an001 ~]$ globus transfer my-personal-external-endpoint-id:myDataFileName_here.txt \
    6ba73d87-08f2-463e-bf8f-83cc3e7a871f:First.Last/myDataFileName_there.txt

.. _firewall-modifications:

Firewall Modification Requests for DTNs
=======================================

By default, only hosts in the noaa.gov domain are able to access the
DTNs. If you need to transfer data using the DTNs from hosts that are
not within the noaa.gov domain, you must submit a request to
open the firewall. Please provide the following information:

* **Summary/Justification for transfer:** Why do you need this and for
  how long (permanent or temporary - specify timeframe if temporary)?
* **Source Systems (DNS name)**: dtn-hera.fairmont.rdhpcs.noaa.gov,
  dtn-jet.boulder.rdhpcs.noaa.gov,
  dtn-niagara.fairmont.rdhpcs.noaa.gov
* **Source IPs**: See below for dtn IPs
* **Destination Systems** (DNS name):
* **Destination IPs**: Use the "host" command to find IPs, see below
* **Destination Port name (s):** Service name (dns, http, nfs, bluearc-admin)
* **Destination Port number (s) or range:**
* **Destination Port protocol (tcp/udp):**
* **Direction:** Which way is the connection being initiated? To NOAA
  RDHPCS Systems (inbound) or out from NOAA RDHPCS Systems (outbound)?
* **An example command:** Please include a typical command to show how
  you will be doing the data transfers

  .. code-block:: shell

    dtn-hera.fairmont.rdhpcs.noaa.gov = 140.208.202.[4-5]
    dtn-jet.boulder.rdhpcs.noaa.gov = 140.208.171.[1-4]
    dtn-niagara.fairmont.rdhpcs.noaa.gov = 140.208.202.[76-77]

* Use the "host" command to find IPs

 .. code-block:: shell

    First.Last@hfe04$ host ruc.noaa.gov
    ruc.noaa.gov has address 140.172.12.92

Example
-------

* **Summary/Justification for transfer:** Requesting (permanent) wget
  access to pull data from ruc.noaa.gov via the Hera DTNs to transfer
  weather data to NOAA R&D systems.
* **Source Systems (DNS name):** dtn-hera.fairmont.rdhpcs.noaa.gov,
  dtn-jet.boulder.rdhpcs.noaa.gov,
  dtn-niagara.fairmont.rdhpcs.noaa.gov
* **Source IPs**: 140.208.202.[4-5], 140.208.171.[1-4], 140.208.202.[76-77]
* **Destination Systems:** ruc.noaa.gov
* **Destination IPs:** 140.172.12.92
* **Destination Port name (s):** HTTP/HTTPS, SSH
* **Destination Port number (s) or range:** 80, 22,443
* **Destination Port protocol (tcp/udp):** tcp
* **Direction:** Outbound
* **An example command:** ``wget -r -A "a-deck-ecmwf-wmo*" https://ruc.noaa.gov/hfip/fiorino/tc/ecmwf/2019/wmo/``

Once the information is reviewed and approved by the security team you
will be able to do your data transfers. Please plan ahead for firewall
requests, review by the security team can take up to two weeks, not
including troubleshooting implementation issues.

Unattended Data Transfers or Password-less Transfers to/from RDHPCs Systems
===========================================================================

For real-time experiments that require data to be transferred
automatically, we support unattended data transfers from @noaa.gov
hosts and other trusted hosts. The actual data flow can be in either
direction, but the connection must be initiated from the remote host.

.. note::

    Unattended data transfers are only allowed on the :ref:`Trusted DTNs
    <transferring-data-trusted-dtn>`.

.. important::

    Unattended data transfers to Gaea can only be completed using `Globus
    App`_, or another method that can authenticate using an X509 certificate,
    e.g., :command:`gsiscp` or :command:`globus-url-copy`.

This capability is intended mainly for projects that can demonstrate a
need where unattended data transfer is required. If you need this
capability, answer the following questions and follow the steps below:


* What command will you be using to do the transfers?
* What is the name of the machine where you'll be running the transfer
  command? In the instructions below we will refer to this as the
  **Remote Host.**
* What is the name of the NOAA-RDHPCS machine that you're trying to
  access? We will refer to this as **RDHPCS-HOST**.

1. Copy the ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub from the remote host above and place it on the
   RDHPCS-HOST in the directory: :file:`~/scp-pubkeys/`.

2. On the RDHPCS-HOST, rename this file so that is is clear where it came from.
   For example, if **Remote Host** was "tide", you can rename the file as
   follows:

   .. code-block:: console

       $ mv ~/scp-pubkeys/id_rsa.pub ~/scp-pubkeys/id_rsa.pub-tide

3. Once this is done, send a help request with subject line **Request
   for unattended data transfer capability"** Include the following
   information:

    * Your username on the RDHPCS-HOST.
    * The full path of the file containing the key from Remote Host.
    * The IP address of the Remote Host

.. note::

    Do not put keys in your home .ssh directory. Put them in
    :file:`$HOME/scp-pubkeys` directory on RDHPCS-HOST.

.. admonition:: WCOSS2 Users Only
   :class: important

   The public key directory on WCOSS2 is :file:`/u/sshKeys/$USER`. You don't
   have to provide the IP addresses when you fill out the information
   requested.

If you do not have an RSA key on the remote system (that is, if you do
not have an id_rsa.pub file in your $HOME/.ssh directory) you can
generate it with (at least on Linux) with the command:

.. code-block:: shell

    # ssh-keygen -t rsa

.. warning::

    When you are prompted for a Passphrase, simply press <Enter>.
    Otherwise you will be prompted for "Passphrase" even if you are
    set up for unattended data transfers and will defeat the purpose!

Jet users can use their public key in their /home/$USER/.ssh directory.
If you have difficulties, contact the support staff for help.

.. _established-tunnel:

Using a Pre-Established SSH Port Tunnel
=======================================

With the SSH port tunnel method, an SSH tunnel is created
between your point of login (typically your desktop) to the remote
host (typically Hera, Jet or other remote hosts). The port tunnel
method will work from any system on the network (that is, your local
machine does not necessarily have to be in the noaa.gov domain). We
recommend using this in cases where DTN is not accessible.

.. _ssh-tunnel:

SSH Port Tunnel from Linux-like systems
---------------------------------------
This method requires two sessions on your local machine: one to
establish the SSH port tunnel, and the other to actually perform the
copy. To establish the port tunnel, you will need to
get the appropriate bastion hostname (CAC or RSA) for the host
you need from the :ref:`bastion_hostnames` table.

Before You Begin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Only the first session to a bastion can establish an ssh tunnel.
You will know that you already have an
existing session when you see messages like

  .. code-block:: shell

    -------------------
    bind [127.0.0.1]:57037: Address already in use
    channel_setup_fwd_listener_tcpip: cannot listen to port: 57037
    Could not request local forwarding.
    -------------------

To establish a new tunnel, do one of the following:


  * Close any existing sessions
  * Open a new session using a bastion where you have no existing sessions.

In the steps below, replace First.Last with your own HPC username, and
XXXXX with the unique Local Port Number assigned to you when you log
in to your specified HPC system (Hera/Jet). Use the word "localhost"
where indicated. It is not a variable, don't substitute anything else.
Before you perform the first step, close all current sessions on the
HPC where system you are trying to connect. Once the first session has
been opened with port forwarding, any further connections (login via
ssh, copy via scp) will work as expected. You are running these
commands on your local machine, not within the HPC system terminal.

As long as this ssh window remains open, you will be able to use this
forwarded port for data transfers. After the first session has been
opened with the port forwarding, any further connections (login via
ssh, copy via scp) will work as expected.

**1. Find your local port number**

To find your unique local port number, log onto your specified HPC
system (Hera/Jet). Make a note of this number - once you've recorded
it, close all sessions. Note that this number will be different on Jet and
Hera.

.. image:: /images/linux_xfer1.png
   :scale: 75%

.. note::
    Open two terminal windows for this process

**Local Client Window #1**

Enter the appropriate command for your environment. Remember to replace XXXXX
with the local port number identified in Step 1 or as needed.

For Windows Power Shell, enter:

.. code-block:: shell

     ssh -m hmac-sha2-512-etm@openssh.com -LXXXXX:localhost:XXXXX First.Last@hera-rsa.boulder.rdhpcs.noaa.gov

For Mac or Linux, enter:

.. code-block:: shell

     ssh -LXXXX:localhost:XXXXX First.Last@hera-rsa.boulder.rdhpcs.noaa.gov

If you will be running X11 applications with x2go or normal terminals,
remember to add the -X parameter as follows:

.. code-block:: shell

    ssh -X -LXXXXX:localhost:XXXXX First.Last@hera-rsa.boulder.rdhpcs.noaa.gov

Note that objects emphasized in this figure should be unique to your
configuration:

.. image:: /images/linux_xfer2.png
   :scale: 75%

Verify that the tunnel is working by doing the following in another local
window from your local machine:

.. code-block:: shell

   ssh -p <port> First.Last@localhost


Note that <port> is your local port number used above, First.Last is
your user ID on the RDHPCS systems and localhost is typed as-is.

You should be prompted for your password; enter your PIN + RSA token
and you should be able to login. Once you are able to log in, you can
log out of that session as that was only for testing the tunnel.

**2. Use SCP to Complete the Transfer**

**Local Client Window #2**

Once the session is open, you can use this forwarded port
for data transfers, as long as this ssh window is kept open. After the
first session has been opened with the port forwarding, any
further connections (login via ssh, copy via scp) will work as
expected.


Remember that this is the second terminal session opened on your local
machine. Once a tunnel has been set up as in Step 1, you
can use a client such as WinSCP to do the transfers using that tunnel.
Please keep in mind that tunnel will exist only as long as the session opened
in Step 1 is kept alive.


.. code-block:: shell

  Hostname: localhost
  Port: your-assigned-port-used-in-Step1-above
  File protocol: SFTP




To transfer a file **to** HPC Systems


For Windows Power Shell, enter:

.. code-block:: shell

  scp -P XXXXX /local/path/to/file First.Last@localhost:/path/to/file/on/HPCSystems

For Mac or Linux, enter:

.. code-block:: shell

  rsync <put rsync options here> -e 'ssh -l First.Last -p XXXXX' /local/path/to/files First.Last@localhost:/path/to/files/on/HPCSystems

.. note::

   Your username is case sensitive when used in the scp command. Username should be in the form of First.Last.

To transfer a file **from** HPC Systems:

For Windows Power Shell, enter:

.. code-block:: shell

    scp -P XXXXX First.Last@localhost:/path/to/file/on/HPCSystems /local/path/to/file

For Mac or Linux, enter:

.. code-block:: shell

    rsync <put rsync options here> -e 'ssh -l First.Last -p XXXXX' First.Last@localhost:/path/to/files/on/HPCSystems /local/path/to/files


In either case, you will be asked for a password. Enter the password
from your RSA token (not your passphrase). Your response should be
your PIN+Token code.

PuTTY is an SSH client, used to configure and initiate connection.
Navigate to a separate tab to install `PuTTY
<http://www.putty.org/>`_. If you cannot install software on your
machine, contact your local systems administrator.

**Configuration**

Enter host information to configure an SSH Terminal Session. The
example below defines a session to Jet via the Boulder Bastion:

.. image:: /images/putty1.png
   :scale: 75%

1. Enter Username
In the left pane under Connection, select "Data" and enter your NOAA
user name as it appears in your NOAA email address. (Ex: Robin.Lee
if your NOAA email is Robin.Lee@noaa.gov). User name is case
sensitive - First.Last. If you do not create a username, you will have
to enter your user name each time your open a session.

.. image:: /images/putty2.png
   :scale: 75%

Complete the configuration:

* Select "Session" from the top of the left pane.
* Select "Save" (between Load and Delete).

**Open a First System Session**

Open the session to make sure it's working, and to record your Local
Port number to complete the Port Tunneling setup.

* Select the configured session from the "Saved Sessions" list. Select
  Load, then Open.
* Enter your unique RSA Passcode.

The RSA passcode is your RSA token PIN followed by 8 digits displayed
on your RSA token. The digits must be on display when you press enter,
or access will be denied. When you open a new SSH session, wait for
the RSA token code to refresh before you enter it.

* Find and record your Local Host number.

.. image:: /images/linux_xfer1.png
    :scale: 75%

* Click **Exit**, or close the Putty window to end the session.

**Port Tunnel Setup**

To enable data transfers, you will need to set up a Port Tunnel.

* Open Putty.
* Select the session from the Saved Sessions list, then Load.
* In the left pane under Connection>SSH select Tunnels.
* Check Local ports accept connections from other hosts.
* In the Source Port field, enter your Local Port number
* In the Destination Port field, enter "localhost:<local port
  number>", where your local port number matches what was entered in
  the Source port.
* Select Local and Auto Radio Buttons.
* Click the Add Button.

.. image:: /images/putty3.png

To save the configuration change:

* In the left pane, select Session.
* Select Save.

Select **Open** to Login and verify that the updated session works correctly.

Create a new Port Tunnel for each SSH system you intend to use. Each
one will have a unique Local Port number.

To add extra saved sessions (ex: for another Bastion) for the same
system (you already have the Local Port number):

* Load your current saved session
* Enter the new host name for the other Bastion
* Give the new session a new name (ex: Jet - Princeton)
* Select Save. The new session will appear in the list of saved sessions.
* Select Open to Login and verify the new session works correctly.



SSH Port Tunnel For Tectia Windows Systems
------------------------------------------

See the :ref:`tectia` pages for complete information.


WinSCP
------

.. note::
  You must have a port tunnel established before you can use WinSCP.
  Configure the port forwarding for WinSCP using the method that
  matches your system configuration.

.. note::
  The port-forwarded session must remain
  active to maintain a connection to WinSCP. Use the word “localhost”
  where indicated. It is not a variable, don't substitute with anything
  else.

Once port forwarding is configured, open and configure WinSCP. Please
be sure to select SFTP as the file protocol.

External Data Transfers (applies to NESCC, ie. Hera and Niagara only)
---------------------------------------------------------------------


Internally Initiated Transfers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

HPC systems do not have specific hosts for internally initiated
transfers. Transfers initiated from HPC Systems use the front end nodes
for doing the transfers.

The firewall rules are set up by default to block all outgoing
traffic. However, we permit internally initiated transfers by request,
after the request is reviewed and approved by the security team. If
you need this capability, send an email to the Help System that
contains your request. Use the subject line: <$SYSTEM> FEs to
<$HOSTNAME> with the appropriate system and hostname.

.. code-block:: shell

  Hera:
  Source Systems:  hfe[1-12].fairmont.rdhpcs.noaa.gov
  Source IPs:  140.208.193.[1-12]
  Jet:
  Source Systems:  fe[1-8].boulder.rdhpcs.noaa.gov
  Source IPs:  140.208.160.[1-8]
  Niagara:
  Source Systems:  nfe[1-12].fairmont.rdhpcs.noaa.gov
  Source IPs:140.208.193.[65-76]

Include the following information in the request:

* **Justification**
* **Source Systems**
* **Source IPs**
* **Destination Systems**
* **Destination IPs**
* **Destination Port name (s):** Service name (dns, http, nfs, bluearc-admin)
* **Destination Port number (s) or range:**
* **Destination Port protocol (tcp/udp):**
* **Example command:** Please include a typical command to show how
  you will be doing the data transfers


Example
-------

* **Subject:** Hera FEs to podaac-tools.jpl.nasa.gov
* **Justification:** Requesting (permanent) wget access to pull data
  from podaac-tools.jpl.nasa.gov via the Hera front ends to transfer
  weather data to NOAA.
* **Source Systems:** hfe[01-12].fairmont.rdhpcs.noaa.gov,

Tuning Hosts to Improve Data Transfer Rates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The standard tuning parameters for network settings are not optimal
for high-latency transfers, which means any transfers to and from Hera
unless you are in West Virginia. These settings are specific to where
you and the latency between your system and Hera. A good place to
start is to change the settings on your local host to match:

.. code-block:: shell

    net.core.rmem_max=16777216
    net.core.wmem_max=16777216
    net.ipv4.tcp_rmem=4096 87380 16777216
    net.ipv4.tcp_wmem=4096 65536 16777216

A good reference for how to tune your host can be found `here <http://fasterdata.es.net/host-tuning/>`_.

Additional tuning can be done depending on where your system is
located, the type of network interface your host has, and many other
options. Please work with your local network administrators to help
tune your local hosts to maximize network performance.

===========================
Globus Online Data Transfer
===========================

Globus is the preferred and most efficient way to transfer data
between DTNs and external storage systems. To use this service, you
must have a NOAA login name and a working RSA SecureID token. You can
invoke Globus functions either through a web interface or from a
command line interface (CLI).

Click here to access `Globus Documentation <https://docs.globus.org/guides/>`_.
Click here to review the `Globus Tutorial <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jKAcRGAInmWarUQ_OV7_xsiUesZPX5Ck/view>`_

Overview
========

An endpoint is a file transfer location (computer/server) accessible
to Globus. A collection is a server with a related access method to
files. Untrusted collections can transfer data to and from anywhere.
Trusted collections can transfer data to and from other vetted
collections. When you log into Globus and click Collections, you can
see what collections are shared with you, and also those that you
share with others. Globus lets you navigate through collections to
find source and target endpoints for your transfer, then select
directories or files to be transferred. The transfer itself is a
background process.

To copy a file, several files, or an entire directory between two systems,
navigate to the `Globus App <https://app.globus.org/>`_.  Locate the source and
target endpoints by their given names and follow these steps:


 #. Authenticate yourself to both endpoints.
 #. Select the Directory Listing panel for each Endpoint.
 #. Pick a directory in each panel for your source and destination.
 #. Click START to initiate the transfer.

Example
-------

 #. Navigate to globus.org.
 #. Select “existing organizational login" NOAA RDHPCS. The File
    Manager page displays.
 #. Select Collection, and choose the file system
    “noaardhpcs#mercury_untrusted”. If necessary, authenticate with
    username and RSA password.
 #. In the File Manager, select Path:
    /collab1/data_untrusted/anonymous/from Orion
 #. Repeat for the other endpoint: msuhpc2#Orion-dtn
 #. Select files and directories, and click Start.

NOAA RDHPCS Globus Endpoint Types
=================================

.. Note::

  It is preferable to use Trusted Endpoints for data transfer.

NOAA RDHPCS Globus Endpoints are either ''trusted'' or ''untrusted''.

* All RDHPCS systems provide DTN's
* DTNs have full access to the back-end file systems.
* DTNs only accept connections from pre-authorized sites. If your site
  can't access the DTNs and you need that capability, submit a help
  desk ticket. If the security team approves, your site will be
  pre-authorized.

NOAA RDHPCS UDTN's (Globus Untrusted Endpoint)
----------------------------------------------

UDTNs can accept connections and transfer data to and from any
location.  UDTNs have access to a specific directory of the back-end
file system, where files can be staged solely for the purpose of
transferring data.

Since your project space is not accessible from the UTDN, transferring
data to and from RDHPCS systems using the UDTN's is a two-step
process.

#. Copy the data out of your project space to the staging area and
   then pull data out of the UDTN from the remote machine.
#. To transfer data back to the RDHPCS system, push the data to the
   UDTN, then copy the file(s) from the staging area to your project
   space.

NOAA RDHPCS Object Stores in the Cloud
--------------------------------------

RDHPCS maintains Cloud Stores in Microsoft Azure, Amazon S3, and
Google Cloud. From the Globus perspective, connecting to these types
of resources is identical to any other endpoints serving DTNs.

The RDHPCS Globus plan offers connectors to access data to and from a
public site available via AWS resources.

#. Navigate to globus.org.
#. Select “existing organizational login" NOAA RDHPCS. The File
   Manager page displays.
#. Select Collection, and search for NOAARDHPCS# collections.
#. Once you can see the file lists, you can use the "File Manager" to
   move the files between the desired endpoints.

Globus Command Line Interface (CLI)
===================================

Globus CLI is available on Jet, Ursa, Hera, and Mercury.
Please load the "globus-cli" module by running the command:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ module load globus-cli

The above module also defines environment variables for the UUIDs
of some of the Globus endpoints that are commonly used by RDHPCS users.
Please run  the command:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ module show globus-cli

to see the environment variables that are defined when
you load the above module.

If you would like to use Globus-cli, either on your personal machine
or on a system where globus-cli is not installed, you can install it
easily . Instructions to install and use the Globus CLI are available
in the Globus documentation `CLI section <https://docs.globus.org/cli>`_.

Transferring Data to and from Your Computer
===========================================

To transfer data from your laptop/workstation to a NOAA RDHPCS system, you can

* Use Globus Connect Personal to transfer data between a NOAA RDHPCS
  UDTN and your local laptop/workstation.
* Use ``scp`` to a NOAA RDHPCS UDTN, using configured ssh port tunnels.
* Use ``scp`` to a NOAA RDHPCS UDTN where permitted (Jet, Hera)

.. note::

  NOAA RDHPCS considers your laptop/workstation a Globus Untrusted Endpoint.

Benefits of using Globus Connect Personal with UDTNs:

* Data can be transferred directly between your computer and an
  Untrusted Endpoint.
* Much faster transfer rates compared to ``scp`` and ``sftp``.
* Data transfers automatically suspend and resume as your computer
  goes to sleep, wakes up, or reboots.
* The mechanism for transferring data between your laptop/workstation
  (Untrusted Endpoint) and a NOAA RDHPCS UDTN is exactly the same.

Please see `Globus Connect Personal
<https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-personal>`_ for information
about setting up your laptop/workstation as a Globus Personal
Endpoint.

.. warning::

    Please note the following warnings when using the Globus Online transfers.

    * Globus transfers do not preserve file permissions. Arriving files will
      have (rw-r-r-) permissions, meaning arriving files will have user read
      and write permissions and group and world read permissions. Note that the
      arriving files will not have any execute permissions, so you will need to
      use chmod to reset execute permissions before running a
      Globus-transferred executable.
    * Globus will overwrite files at the destination with identically named
      source files. This is done without warning.
    * Globus has restriction of 8 active transfers across all the users. Each
      user has a limit of 3 active transfers, so it is required to transfer a
      lot of data on each transfer than less data across many transfers.
    * If a folder is constituted with mixed files including thousands of small
      files (less than 1MB each one), it would be better to tar the small files.
      Otherwise, if the files are larger, Globus will handle them.

Data Sharing with External Collaborators
========================================

.. Note::

  For a more complete discussion, see :ref:`transferring-data`.

RDHPCS users can share data with external collaborators who do not have
accounts on the RDHPCS system. You can share data files with external
collaborators, both inbound and outbound, using the Untrusted DTNs (UDTNs). The
process is described in this section.

**For data that is short-lived**, and not broadly shared with external users
use RDHPCS end-points.

**For data that is expected to be available for three 3 months
or more**, use the :ref:`institutional_data_portal` end-point.

**For data that is expected to be permanent** (e.g., >3 months), use the GFDL
institutional data portal end-point (noaagfdl#data_portal). This is for
outbound sharing of data only. The data group will provide a Globus url to
the data hosted upon completion of the data hosting.

Data hosted on the GFDL Data portal servers is accessible through Globus, and
available on request through the `data hosting request form
<https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScH-2mMLHesN6DJlxLEVU6Kg8wXEKvEr-JgB_5nXchjCDrYww/viewform>`__
for papers, collaborations, and other projects. The requester will be notified
of the Globus URL when the request is completed. GFDL Data Transfer features
can be reviewed in `this table.
<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fVC60ztNzYxFui1zyF_S_AMfoc3O15oa1-oOKhGrqQI/edit?gid=0#gid=0>`_

For assistance, contact the GFDL team at oar.gfdl.dpteam@noaa.gov.

.. note::

  Refer to the `GFDL FAIR use and GFDL Data DOI policy
  <https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/fair-use-policy/>`_ for external data sharing.

.. Note::

  * This data sharing feature is only available only on *untrusted*
    Globus endpoints (UDTNs).
  * You **must** share the collection with your collaborators.
    **THERE IS CURRENTLY NO PUBLIC SHARING AVAILABLE.**   You can share to an
    email address or a GlobusID.
  * You can only share directories under your ``/*/data_untrusted/$USER`` directory.
  * Before any sharing can be done, the user that is sharing the data
    must login to the system (Mercury, Ursa (WIP), Hera, Jet, ...) at least once,
    to make sure that the account is properly set up the with the necessary
    home and project directories.
  * It may be necessary to create (``mkdir``) your ``/*/data_untrusted/$USER``
    directory, depending on the system.

Refer to the :ref:`Globus Collection Summary <globus_collection_summary>` to
find the names of relevant Globus
Collections, and the exposed directory names.

How to Share Data
-----------------

The Globus web site provides complete instructions for sharing
your data. Click here for `file sharing instructions. <https://docs.globus.org/how-to/share-files/>`_

When you log into the Globus web site and click **Collections**, you can see
what collections are shared with you, and also those that you share with
others.

.. _globus_example:

Globus Example
==============

Globus is the preferred and most efficient and robust way to transfer
data between Globus Collections and Endpoints (also known as DTNs) and
external storage systems. To use this service, you must have an RDHPCS
NOAA account and an RSA SecureID token. You can invoke Globus
functions either through a web interface or from a command line
interface (CLI).  Click the link to access `Globus Documentation
<https://docs.globus.org/guides/>`__.

The following is an example for the purpose of illustration, provided
for people  who need to get data moving from source to destination
without delay.

What you need to have on hand
-----------------------------

* Your NOAA username (First.Last), and your RDHPCS MFA token.
* The name and source of the destination endpoints, e.g.,
  *noaardhpcs#ppan_untrusted*, *noaardhpcs#hera*.
* The file systems exposed to the endpoints (e.g.,
  ``/collab1/data_untrusted``, ``/scratch4/``).

What you need to do
-------------------

1. Navigate to the `Globus Web App <https://app.globus.org>`_
2. Login with an existing organizational login, e.g., *NOAA RDHPCS*.
3. In the Globus File Manager's *Collection* dialog, search for the
   destination endpoint (e.g., *noaardhpcs#ppan_untrusted*).
4. In the *Path* dialog, select the endpoint's file system path (e.g.,
   ``/collab1/data_untrusted/First.Last``).
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for the second endpoint.
6. Select the files/directory to transfer.
7. Click the *Start* button.

must login to Globus with your NOAA RDHPCS credentials.


Publicly accessible buckets, no keys required
---------------------------------------------

As an example, let us consider the case where user needs to get files from the
NOAA RRFS experiment from the `AWS Cloud
<https://noaa-rrfs-pds.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html#rrfs_a/rrfs_a.20230725/00/control/>`_.


Go to `<https://registry.opendata.aws/>`_.

In the "Search datasets" field enter the data set of interest, in this case: noaa-rrfs (the first part of the URL of interest)
Click on the results listed in the right pane of the window: This will lead to: `<https://registry.opendata.aws/noaa-rrfs/>`_.

From that web page, copy the last part of the ARN (in this example
noaa-rrfs-pds): arn:aws:s3:::noaa-rrfs-pds Now you have the info you need.


    1. Login to <https://www.globus.org/> with your
       NOAA identity.
    2. In the File Manager window

  - Enter into the "Collection" field: noaardhpcs#cloud_aws_s3_public
  - Enter into the "Path" field:
    /noaa-rrfs-pds/rrfs_a/rrfs_a.20230725/00/control/

Once you are able to see the listing of files you can use the "File Manager" to
move the files between the desired endpoints.

.. note::

  Module globus-cli needs to be loaded before any globus commands are used.

For Globus CLI use, the endpoint UUID is given by:

.. code-block:: shell

  $ globus endpoint search noaardhpcs#cloud_aws_s3_public

You may save the UUID in an environment variable you create, e.g.:
RDHPCS_AWS_PUBLIC. From here on, normal Globus CLI methods will work.

For example, to get a directory listing, type

.. code-block:: shell

  $ globus ls -l $RDHPCS_AWS_PUBIC\:/noaa-rrfs-pds/

#. Navigate to globus.org.
#. Select the “existing organizational login” NOAA RDHPCS. The File
   Manager page displays.
#. Select Collection, and search for NOAARDHPCS# collections.
#. Once you can see the file lists, you can use the “File Manager” to
   move the files between the desired endpoints.

Non-public, secret keys required
--------------------------------
There are non-public sites, curated by the owners. To access the sites,
owners must provide you with two things:

- AWS IAM Access Key ID
- AWS IAM Secret Key

To gain access, you must use a specific endpoint name available through the
RDHPCS subscription.

1. In the File Manager search for and select
   noaardhpcs#cloud_aws_s3_authenticated1 or
   noaardhpcs#cloud_aws_s3_authenticated2

.. note::

  There are endpoints provided to facilitate transfers from one cloud bucket to another in case it is needed.

2. Click on the three vertical dots to the right of the Collection field
3. Select the *Credentials* tab.

If the STATUS column shows *invalid*, click the wrench icon.
Enter the **Access Key ID** and **Secret key**, and hit **Continue**,
and you have access to the contents of the S3 bucket.

.. warning::

  Because the access/secret key combination is specific to only one collection,
  you can only be connected to at most one bucket at a time.

**Change buckets**

If you need to access a different bucket with this mechanism, you must delete
your working AWS Access Credentials first, so you create a different one linked
to the new bucket. As above, when you select the Credentials tab, you will see
the STATUS as active. To remove these credentials, so you can create a new
association with the new access key/secret, click on the trash can
icon.

Globus Command Line Interface (CLI)
===================================

The CLI is available on Jet, Ursa (WIP), Hera, and Niagara. If you would like to
use Globus-cli, either on your personal machine or on a system where
globus-cli is not installed, you can install it easily. Refer to the
instructions to install and use the `Globus CLI
<https://docs.globus.org/cli/>`_.

Transferring Data to and from Your Computer
===========================================

To transfer data from your laptop/workstation to a NOAA RDHPCS system, you can

* use *scp* to a NOAA RDHPCS DTN (using pre-configured SSH port
  tunnels.
* use *scp* to a NOAA RDHPCS UDTN
* use `Globus Connect Personal
  <https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-personal>`_ to transfer data
  between a NOAA RDHPCS UDTN and your local laptop/workstation.

NOAA RDHPCS considers your laptop/workstation as a Globus Untrusted Endpoint.

Some benefits of using Globus Connect Personal with UDTNs:

* Data can be transferred directly between your computer and an
  Untrusted Endpoint.
* Faster transfer rates as compared to scp and sftp.
* Data transfers automatically suspends and resumes as your computer
  goes to sleep, wakes up, or reboots.

The mechanism for transferring data between your laptop/workstation
(Untrusted Endpoint) and a NOAA RDHPCS UDTN is exactly the same. See
`Globus Connect Personal`_ for information about setting up your
laptop/workstation as a Globus Personal Endpoint.

.. _institutional_data_portal:

GFDL Institutional Data Portal
==============================

Data hosted on the GFDL Data portal servers is accessible through Globus, and
available on request through the `data hosting request form
<https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScH-2mMLHesN6DJlxLEVU6Kg8wXEKvEr-JgB_5nXchjCDrYww/viewform>`__ for papers,
collaborations, and other projects. The requester will be notified of the
Globus URL when the request is completed. GFDL Data Transfer features can be
reviewed in `this table.
<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fVC60ztNzYxFui1zyF_S_AMfoc3O15oa1-oOKhGrqQI/edit?gid=0#gid=0>`_

.. note::

  Information shared through the GFDL portal is shared permanently.

.. _migrating_local:


Migrating Data Between Local File Systems
=========================================

.. note::

    Large scale data migration can be challenging and time consuming. Please
    review the following guidelines and tools to minimize the time it takes to
    move your data and ensure successful and complete migration

General Guidelines
------------------

#. **Size the dataset and prune unneeded data.**
   Use tools such as ``du``, ``tree`` on the directories to understand the
   data volumes.  Ensure there are no duplicate data sets, temporary
   working files, or other unneeded content.  **The most efficient way
   to move data is to reduce the data to move.** Use ``tar`` or ``zip``
   archiving tools to collapse directories into a single file.  As
   appropriate, archive directories to the site-specific HSMS and
   delete from scratch file systems.
#. **Start early and leave plenty of time for migration.**
   Be aware that everyone on the filesystems will be moving data.
   Even with data sizes in hand, with limited insight into the data
   structure of individual directories, it is hard to predict exactly
   how long a transfer might take.  **Be sure to plan far ahead and
   leave yourself plenty of time to complete a migration!** Note that
   transferring many small files is often worse than a few large files
   because performance is more strongly related to the time it takes
   to access a file, not transfer it.
#. **Make sure that the user performing the copy has permissions to
   read all data in the directory to be transferred.** If a directory
   has files or sub-directories which are restricted, you will need to
   split it up into multiple transfers as multiple users, or change
   ownership on the source data first.
#. **Disable all batch and cron jobs that may be modifying the
   directories to be transferred!** Any create/modify/delete changes
   can result in errors for any data transfer tool. For transfer of a
   large directory it may be OK to perform an initial copy
   **interactively**, but definitely quiesce access before performing
   a final sync.
#. **Use a synchronization tool (NOT just** ``cp`` or ``mv`` **) and
   don't rely on a one-time transfer completing perfectly.** This is
   important because you will most likely have to run the process more
   than once, and tools such as rsync will skip already copied
   files. Then go back and delete the source data once you have
   confirmed the copy is complete.
#. **For small data volumes, use an interactive session** on an HPCS head
   node.  In the unlikely event the volume of data to move is less
   than a terabyte (TB) / 1,000 gigabytes (GB) it is appropriate to
   use a head node to do an 'ad-hoc' data transfer using a tool such
   as rsync.
#. **For larger data volumes, submit a batch job** to a 'dtn' or similar
   queue

Suggested Tools
---------------

du
---

An original part of Unix, the ``du`` disk usage tool will be found on
every HPCS.  It can provide a simple overview of the usage of a file
or directory.  Output can be easily sorted by piping the output
through ``sort``.  One example command is:

.. code-block:: shell

   du -sk DIRECTORY/* | sort -n

- ``-s`` will summarize sub directory usage
- ``-k`` will output in 1024-byte (1 kiB) blocks
- ``| sort -n`` pipes the output through the sort, sorted numerically

tree
----

A highly useful but optional part of Linux systems that `should` be
installed on all NOAA RDHPCS, the ``tree`` tool provides
tree-structured output about a directory with the option to summarize
and calculate usage.  One example command is:

.. code-block:: shell

        tree --du -h -d -L 2 --sort=size DIRECTORY

- ``--du`` will calculate disk usage on directories
- ``-h`` will display human-readable (K,M,G,T) volumes
- ``-d`` will summarize directories
- ``-L 2`` will only show two levels of directories
- ``--sort=size`` will sort output by size

.. code-block:: shell

    % tree --du -h -d --sort=size -L 2 .

Local Data Migration note and table

.. attention::

   Do *not* use the ``du`` or ``tree`` command on the lustre filesystems listed below:


+-------------+-------------+
| Cluster     | File System |
+=============+=============+
|| Jet        || /lfs5      |
||            || /lfs6      |
+-------------+-------------+
|| Hera, Ursa || /scratch3  |
||            || /scratch4  |
+-------------+-------------+


rsync
-----

For basic migration, it is recommended to use the ``rsync`` tool to
transfer the files and directories. One example command is:

.. code-block:: shell

    rsync --archive --verbose --one-file-system /full/path/to/source/directory/ /full/path/to/destination/directory

.. warning::

    It is very important that you have a trailing slash after the
    source directory: ``/full/path/to/source/directory/`` **/**. If you do not,
    a second invocation of the same command will attempt to retransfer all of
    the data into a subdirectory, for example:

    ``/full/path/to/source/directory/directory``.

- ``--archive`` (``-a``) will ensure all ownership and dates are
  preserved in the transfer.
- ``--verbose`` (``-v``) will display details of every file being
  transferred. If you have lots of small files, this will slow down the
  transfer processes.
- ``--one-file-system`` (``-x``) restricts the transfer to the source
  filesystem. This is important when symlinks are used to point to
  data that exists on other filesystems.

To keep the two directories exactly the same, use ``--delete`` -- if
the file **did not** exist in source, you want it removed on
destination if does exist:

- ``--delete`` means to remove files from the destination that are not in the
  source directory. If after a completed rsync a file was then removed from the
  source, then the next rsync with the ``--delete`` option would then remove
  the file from the destination/ It may be preferable to clean up the source
  only after confirming that all the files have been transferred.

.. warning::

    Do not use the ``--delete`` option if you do not want data in the
    destination directory to be removed.

xsync
-----

On Jet and Hera, an additional data synchronization tool,
``xsync`` is available in ``/apps/local/bin``. It is an unsupported
wrapper around ``rsync``,
``find``, and ``xargs`` that performs multi-threaded transfers.

Usage of ``xsync`` is almost identical to ``rsync`` as described above.

.. note::

    ``xsync`` does not support the ``--include`` and ``--exclude``
    rsync options.  To view additional parameters to tune threading
    and depth for better performance, run ``xsync --help``. In most
    cases they should not be needed.


A sample batch script to transfer data
--------------------------------------

Here is a sample batch script that can be used as a template, then
submitted to the batch system to perform the data movement:

.. code-block:: shell

    #!/bin/bash

    #SBATCH --job-name=data-transfer
    #SBATCH --partition=PARTITION_GOES_HERE
    #SBATCH --time=08:00:00
    #SBATCH --nodes=1
    #SBATCH --output=$HOME/data-transfer-job-%j

    set -x

    SRC=/path/to/source/directory/                 # Note trailing slash
    DEST=/path/to/destination/directory

    echo "$(date) : Starting sync from $SRC to $DEST"

    rsync -ax $SRC $DEST

    echo "$(date) : Ending sync from $SRC to $DEST"


Before using this template, replace the ``PARTITION_GOES_HERE`` with
the appropriate partition for the HPCS being used.  Refer to the
system-specific pages for that information.

After updating the template and saving it locally as a batch job,
submit it to the batch system. Watch for the exit status -- if it does
not finish in 8 hours, resubmit it. Once it finishes successfully, add
``-v`` to the rsync line and submit it one more time. Examine the
output file carefully to make sure there are no errors.

If after several tries, the transfer still hasn't completed, and the
errors are not obvious upon reading the batch job output, refer to the
:ref:`getting help <getting_help>` pages and ask for assistance.  Be
sure and include the file paths of the output files of your transfer
jobs for best assistance.

Known Issues
============

My job runs to completion but the files are not transferred
-----------------------------------------------------------

Look at the job output for obvious errors.  It will be in your home
directory in a file starting with ``data-transfer-job-``.  If your job
completes and the files appear to not to have transferred, read that
file for clues.

If you are not a regular user of the batch system, it is likely that
your initialization files are printing messages (typically with
``echo`` command in the initialization files) that are causing the
jobs to fail.

If this happens you could rename your initialization files (.cshrc, .tcshrc,
.bashrc, .login, .profile, .bash_profile, etc) temporarily and try again.
A better solution is to address the problems caused by these initialization
files.

Were all my files transferred?
------------------------------

Look at the job output.  It will be in your home directory in a file
starting with ``data-transfer-job-``.  When the job completes read
that file for clues and any errors.  You can ignore WARNings, and
other messages, but any message with the string "FATAL" suggests an
incomplete transfer.  It can happen because you ran out of time, or
there may be other problems.  If your job exited because it ran out of
time you should be able to resubmit the job but be sure to add the
**--resume** option.
