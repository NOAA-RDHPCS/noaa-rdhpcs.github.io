Data and Transfers
##################

Available on Gaea is a tool called GCP, which allows for internal transfers on
Gaea and to/from other NOAA RDHPCS resources (ZEUS and GFDL PPAN). Please
reference System Details if you are unfamiliar with the filesystems or expected
use of each variety of node on Gaea.

Available Tools
===============

-  GCP
-  spdcp - lustre to lustre specific
-  globus-url-copy (GridFTP)
-  scp
-  rsync
-  cp
-  hsi and htar (for Zeus' HPSS)

We suggest all users use GCP as the primary data transfer tool.

Examples
========

f2 <-> f2
---------

Users can transfer data between the lustre f2 filesystem using GCP. This can be
done on the login nodes, and ldtns Gco commands issued on the compute nodes will
result in a [L|R]DTN job being created and gcp will block until that job is
completed by defaut.

.. code-block:: shell
  :linenos:

  module load gcp
  gcp /lustre/f2/dev/$USER/file /lustre/f2/scratch/$USER/path/file

Gaea <-> GFDL
-------------

Users can transfer data between GFDL and Gaea filesystems with GCP. This can be
done on the login nodes and rdtn's only. Users can interactively run gcp
commands from a login node or submit gcp calls in scripts to run in the rdtn
queue.

.. code-block:: shell
  :linenos:

  module load gcp
  gcp gaea:/lustre/f2/scratch/$USER/file gfdl:/gfdl/specific/path/file
  gcp gfdl:/gfdl/specific/path/file gaea:/lustre/f2/dev/$USER/path/file

Gaea <-> Remote NOAA Site
-------------------------

Users can transfer data between GFDL and Gaea filesystems with GridFTP, rsync or
scp. This can be done on the login nodes and RDTNs only. Please place large
transfers (>1GB) in batch jobs on the RDTN queue. This will respect other users
on the login nodes by reducing interactive impact.

.. code-block:: shell
  :linenos:

  scp /lustre/f2/scratch/$USER/path/name/here some.remote.site:/a/path/over/there
  globus-url-copy file:/path/on/Gaea/file gsiftp://some.remote.site/path/to/destination/file
  globus-url-copy gsiftp://some.remote.site/path/to/remote/file file:/destination/path/on/Gaea/file

Gaea <-> External
-----------------

Users can use port tunnels associated with their login sessions to move files
between Gaea and their workstations. NOAA users will find this to be far slower
than GCP. NOTE TO SELF add list back in if the build works

.. code-block:: shell
  :linenos:

  Host gaea
    HostName                gaea.rdhpcs.noaa.gov
    User                    First.Last
    ControlMaster           auto
    LocalForward            uid+30000 localhost:uid+30000
    RemoteForward           uid+20000 localhost:22
    NoHostAuthenticationForLocalhost yes

.. code-block::
  :linenos:

  Host gaea1 gaea2 gaea3 gaea4 gaea5 gaea6 gaea7 gaea8 gaea?.ncrc.gov
    HostName                localhost
    Port                    uid+30000
    User                    First.Last
    LogLevel                Quiet

.. code-block::
  :linenos:

  Host *
    CheckHostIP yes
    ForwardAgent            yes
    ForwardX11Trusted       yes
    ControlPath ~/.ssh/%r@%h:%p
    ControlMaster           no
    AddressFamily       inet
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/ntt_id_rsa
    ServerAliveInterval     60

- Run: ssh gaea
- Check that your tunnels get created (there will be a bit of output near the banner about this.)
- In your Gaea session, cd to the location you want your file to be transferred to.
- In your Gaea session, run scp -P 50017 your_workstation_username@localhost:/path/to/file .

Gaea <-> NESCC HPSS
-------------------

Users can transfer data between Gaea and Zeus' High Performance Storage System
(HPSS) through the use of the HSI and HTAR commands. These commands are only
available on Gaea's Remote Data Transfer Nodes (RDTNs). A user can submit a
script to run on the RDTNs.

Minimum Headers for a submitted RDTN job.

.. code-block:: shell

  #SBATCH --clusters=es
  #SBATCH --partition=rdtn


Load the HSI module and list the contents of your directory

.. code-block:: shell

  module load hsi

Check connectivity to the hsi, replacing the below file path with yours on HPSS

.. code-block:: shell

  hsi "ls -P /BMC/nesccmgmt/$USER/"

Retrieve Files using HSI into the current directory on the RDTN. The -q option limits output spam.

.. code-block:: shell

  hsi -q "get /BMC/nesccmgmt/Karol.Zieba/sample_file"

Upload Files using HSI

.. code-block:: shell

  hsi -q "put /lustre/f2/scratch/$USER/file_to_upload : /BMC/nesccmgmt/$USER/file_to_upload"

Tar many small files from the RDTN using HTAR. Note that using asterisk will not work.

.. code-block:: shell

  htar cf /BMC/nesccmgmt/$USER/tarred_file.tar file1 file2 path/file3

Untar many small files into your current directory on the RDTN using HTAR

.. code-block:: shell

  htar xf /BMC/nesccmgmt/$USER/tarred_file.tar

External (Untrusted) Data Transfers
-----------------------------------

To support external data transfers with methods that are faster and simpler than
the port tunnel method, NOAA RDHPCS has a data transfer node. This means data
can be transferred to Gaea without the use of the port tunnel or existing ssh
connection. Not only is this simpler, but provides for much faster transfers.
The difference between the eDTN and the DTN as described above is that the eDTN
does not mount the Gaea filesystems. Transferring through the eDTN to Gaea
requires a two step process. First, files are transferred from external hosts to
the eDTN. Second, from Gaea, the files are pulled back from the eDTN.

For authentication, use of your token is required from external transfers to the
eDTN. From within Gaea, use of your token is not required.

The eDTN supports the use of scp, sftp, bbcp, and ssh based globus-url-copy.

Copying files from external systems to the eDTN
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: shell

  jsmith# scp WRF.tar.gz John.Smith@edtn.fairmont.rdhpcs.noaa.gov:
  Access is via First.Last username only.  Enter RSA PASSCODE:

The trailing colon (``:``) is critical. You can also specify ``:/home/John.Smith/``

Your response should be your pin+PASSCODE.

Retrieving files on Gaea from the eDTN
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To transfer files from the eDTN server to Gaea without requiring your token, you
must use GSI enabled transfer methods. For scp, sftp, and bbcp, this mean
appending "gsi" to the front of the command. So the commands that are best to
use are gsiscp, gsisftp, and gsibbcp.

To pull the files back from the eDTN, initiate on of these commands:

.. code-block:: shell

  John.Smith# gsiscp -S `which gsissh` edtn.fairmont.rdhpcs.noaa.gov:WRF.tar.gz .

eDTN Purge Policy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Files older than 7 days will be automatically removed. This policy may change
based on disk space and management needs.

Managing files on the eDTN
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you need to login and manage any files, create or remove directories, or any
other tasks on the eDTN, use gsisftp from Gaea. This provides and FTP like
interface through ssh.

.. code-block:: shell

  > sftp -S `which gsissh` John.Smith@edtn.fairmont.rdhpcs.noaa.gov
  Access is via First.Last username only. Enter RSA PASSCODE:
  Connected to edtn.fairmont.rdhpcs.noaa.gov.
