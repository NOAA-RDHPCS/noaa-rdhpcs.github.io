How to Write a Good Help Ticket
###############################

* Use a descriptive subject
* Good: Job failing on gaea, *error* bus error
* Bad: job failing
* Good: 500 Error on product detail page or When I click the link below I get a 404/Page Not Found Error.
* Bad: Site is BROKEN!!


* Say where the problem occurred
* Provide the system, and if possible, the host.  
* Include the job ID, and time the job started, along with the job's script and stdout file.

* Provide steps to reproduce the issue
* List all the steps required to reproduce the problem.  
* If it helps, write the steps so that any of the GFDL computer operators can run the steps to reproduce the issue.  This includes the steps taken to load modules, etc. 
* Is this reproducible on other systems, and/or by others?

* Describe what you did to fix the problem
* List any trouble-shooting steps you took, along with their results

* Include other useful information
* What error messages did you get?
* What did you expect to happen?
