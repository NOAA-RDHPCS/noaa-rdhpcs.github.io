RSA Software Token User Instructions
####################################

.. attention::

   Users are allowed *one* RSA token.  Choose one mobile platform --
   Apple or Android -- to use your RSA soft token on.

.. attention::

   You **cannot reuse** an authentication token.  If you get a new
   mobile device, start at Step 1 here and request a new activation
   code.

Step 1: Submit the RSA token request form and receive response email
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Access the RDHPCS `AIM <https://aim.rdhpcs.noaa.gov>`_ site and follow
the link labeled "Make a request for an RSA token".

.. note::

   If you have problems logging into `AIM`_, you are probably a new or
   returning NOAA user and need to set up the NOAA MFA (Multi Factor
   Authentication).  Please try logging into the `NOAA Staff Directory
   <https://accounts.noaa.gov>`_ and contact your local I/T support
   people if you cannot login.

Wait for an email from the RDHPCS Accounts Team that provides the
activation code and URL.

.. attention:: The activation code and URL is only good for seven (7) days!

Step 2: Install the application
-------------------------------

.. hint::

   If you already have the RSA application installed on your device,
   do not install it again.  You only need to add a token by using the
   “+” in the app.

Use these links to install the app on your mobile device.  If you
cannot use the links, search the app store for "RSA Authenticator".
The app icons will look like these:

.. |android icon|	image:: /images/rsa_app_android.png
.. |apple icon|		image:: /images/rsa_app_apple.png
.. |android url|	replace:: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rsa.securidapp&hl=en_US
.. |mac url|		replace:: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rsa-authenticator-securid/id318038618



+--------------+----------------+--------------------------------+
| Type         | Link           | Icon                           |
+==============+================+================================+
| Android      |  |android url| | |android icon|                 |
+--------------+----------------+--------------------------------+
| iPhone, iPad |  |mac url|     | |android icon| or |apple icon| |
+--------------+----------------+--------------------------------+


Step 3: Configure the application
---------------------------------

If at all possible, read or forward the "RDHPCS Software Token
Activation" email to your mobile device so the activation information
can be copy and pasted.  It is permitted to forward that email to a
personal address for the purposes of RSA activation.

Step 3a: Copy the activation URL
--------------------------------

Do this step if you can view the activation email on your mobile device.

- On your mobile device, view the "RDHPCS Software Token Activation"
  email.  Select and copy the Activation URL.

.. important::

   **COPY THE ENTIRE ACTIVATION URL**

Step 3b: Enter the activation URL
---------------------------------

- On your mobile device, open the RSA application.

- Click on the **+** in the upper right corner

- Click the 'Registration Code or URL' field

- Paste, or type in, the activation URL.  **Make sure the URL starts
  with https://authenticator.securid.com/securid/ctf/**

Refer to this screenshot:

.. attention::

   **Leave the email and organization fields blank!!**

Step 3c: Click the Submit button
--------------------------------

You have filled in the URL field **and the email and organization
fields are blank.**

- The **Submit** button should now be active.  Click it.

Step 4: Set the RSA PIN
-----------------------

- Access the `RDHPCS SSLVPN <https://sslvpn.rdhpcs.noaa.gov/>`_

- The username is the "First.Last" portion of your NOAA email address.

- Open the RSA application.  Enter the eight digit code displayed.

- Follow the prompts to enter or set a PIN

  Use 4 to 8 alphanumeric characters.

- Confirm the PIN by re-entering it.

.. note::

   Do remember your PIN.  When you are asked to enter your RSA
   passcode, you will enter your PIN followed by the 8 digit number
   displayed in the RSA app on your mobile device.

- Once complete, you may close that browser window.


Step 5: Success!
----------------

You have now activated your NOAA RDHPCS RSA token.  Proceed with
accessing the desired HPCS resources.
