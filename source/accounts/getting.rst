Getting an RDHPCS Account
=========================

There are four NOAA RDHPCS systems and one external system available
to the user community:

- Gaea
- Hera
- Niagara
- Jet
- Orion/Hercules (MSU - external)

The RDHPCS account gives the user access to the Gaea, Hera, Niagara
and Jet, depending on their assigned project.

What NOAA Does
---------------

#. Conducts security investigation (6-12 weeks).  This includes a
   fingerprint check, background check, and DOC public trust
   investigation
#. Provides a **@noaa.gov** email account and initial password. You
   may have access to the NOAA email account before the security
   review is complete. Once you have a noaa.gov email address, you
   also have access to several internal systems.

What You Do
-----------

#. Take the NOAA IT Security Awareness Training (annual requirement).
#. Use the Account Identity Management
   system (`AIM`_) to request access to a
   vetting project. You access AIM using your NOAA.gov email address
   and password.
#. When you are approved for a vetting project, request membership to
   other projects as directed by your management.
#. Request an :ref:`rsa_token` for access to several NOAA systems.
