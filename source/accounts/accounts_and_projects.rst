**New to the NOAA RDHPCS Program?**

Welcome!  The information below introduces how we structure user
accounts, projects, and system allocations. It's all you need to know
about getting to work. In general, NOAA RDHPCS resources are granted
to projects in allocations on systems, and are made available to the
users associated with each project.

Applying for a user account
===========================

Collaborators involved with an approved and activated NOAA RDHPCS
project can apply for a user account associated with it. There are
several steps in receiving a user account, and we're here to help you
through them.

.. note::
    Project PIs do not receive a user account with project creation,
    and must apply for user account to access the NOAA RDHPCS.

First time users must:
#. Have an active NOAA.gov email account.  Your local line office is
  responsible for creating your account, or re-activating your account
  if you have been marked inactive.
#. Have accurate information in `NOAA Accounts Portal <https://accounts.noaa.gov>`__
#. Have enabled Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) for NOAA Single Sign On (SSO).
#. Apply for an RDHPCS account using the `Account
   Information Management (AIM) system <https://aim.rdhpcs.noaa.gov>`__
   by requesting access to the "rdhpcs" project.
#. Request an RSA SecurID token via the `Account Information
   Management (AIM) system`.  Software tokens are faster to issue and
   are preferred if you have a smartphone.
   
NOAA will conduct a security investigation that takes 6-12 weeks.
This will include a fingerprint check, background check, and DOC
public trust investigation.

Foreign national participants have special hoops to jump through.

Once your account request has been vetted by the security team, you
will receive an email from the accounts team and will be able to
proceed to request access to projects allocated to systems.

Request access to RDHPCS projects
=================================

.. attention::
   You must be able to access the `NOAA Accounts Portal` before
   proceeding.

Once you have an RDHPCS account, you can request access to projects
that have allocations on systems.

#. Consult with your supervisor and colleagues to identify the
   project(s) to request access to.
#. Access the `Account Information Management (AIM) system` to request
   project access.  **Provide a clear reason for your request.**
#. The principal investigator (PI) of the project must approve your
   project request.  They will be automatically notified and regularly
   reminded of open requests.
#. Once your project request is approved, a welcome email will be sent
   to you.

Account Activity Requirements: Suspension, Deactivation, Reactivation
=====================================================================

**Your NOAA RDHPCS account must be kept active by accessing the RDHPCS
 at least once every 90 days.**

User accounts are suspended when they has been inactive for 90 days or
more. The user will be notified at their NOAA.gov address if their
account has been suspended, with instructions on reactivation.

Depending on the lengh of account suspension, there may be additional
steps to fully reactivate your account:

.. topic:: Reactivate within seven days

   If you reactivate your account within seven days, your RSA token is
   re-enabled at the same time. Once your account and token are
   re-enabled, you may log into your respective resource and project.

.. topic:: Reactivate after seven days

   If your account has been suspended for more than seven days and you
   had a software token, you must apply for a new token using the `AIM
   system`_.

Deactivated Accounts
--------------------

If your account remains suspended for more than 270 days, it will be
deactivated and loose all project associations.  You will need to
reapply for NOAA RDHPCS access.
