**New to the NOAA RDHPCS Program?**

Welcome!  The information below introduces how we structure user
accounts, projects, and system allocations. It's all you need to know
about getting to work. In general, NOAA RDHPCS resources are granted
to projects in allocations on systems, and are made available to the
users associated with each project.

Applying for a user account
===========================

Collaborators involved with an approved and activated NOAA RDHPCS
project can apply for a user account associated with it. There are
several steps in receiving a user account, and we're here to help you
through them.

.. note::
    Project PIs do not receive a user account with project creation,
    and must apply for user account to access the NOAA RDHPCS.


.. image:: /images/access1.png

Once you have a NOAA.gov email address, you can:

1. Request an RDHPCS account through the Account Information Management
system, **AIM**.

2. Visit the `Account Information Management`_ website and request
access to the RDHPCS project. To do that, log into AIM using your NOAA email
credentials, review your profile for accuracy, and request the RDHPCS project.

.. image:: /images/AIM1.png

Once you've been approved for the RDHPCS project, you will receive an email
containing instructions about your next steps. These include:

#. Requesting access to further projects
#. Completing the RSA token request form.

   Confer with your supervisor and colleagues to identify the project(s) to
   request.


.. _Account Information Management:	https://aim.rdhpcs.noaa.gov
.. _NOAA Accounts Portal:		https://accounts.noaa.gov

First time users must:

#. Have an active NOAA.gov email account.  Your local line office is
   responsible for creating your account, or re-activating your account
   if you have been marked inactive.
#. Have accurate information in `NOAA Accounts Portal`_
#. Have enabled Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) for NOAA Single Sign
   On (SSO).
#. Apply for an RDHPCS account using the `Account Information
   Management`_ website and request access to the **rdhpcs** project.
#. Request an RSA SecurID token via the `Account Information
   Management`_ website.  Software tokens are faster to issue and are
   preferred if you have a smartphone.
#. Request a Common Access Card (CAC)

NOAA will conduct a security investigation that takes 6-12 weeks.
This will include a fingerprint check, background check, and DOC
public trust investigation.

Foreign national participants have special hoops to jump through.

Once your account request has been vetted by the security team, you
will receive an email from the accounts team and will be able to
proceed to request access to projects allocated to systems.

.. note::

    NOAA RDHPCS systems use a **long user name** which is usually the same as your
    NOAA email user name. These pages frequently refer to this long user name as
    *First.Last*.

.. attention::

   You **must** access your NOAA.gov email account regularly.  **All**
   communications about the NOAA RDHPCS program will be sent to your
   NOAA.gov email account.

.. _project_request:

Request access to RDHPCS projects
=================================

.. attention::
   You must be able to access the `NOAA Accounts Portal`_ before
   proceeding.

Once you have an RDHPCS account, you can request access to projects
that have allocations on systems.

#. Consult with your supervisor and colleagues to identify the
   project(s) to request access to.
#. Access the `Account Information Management`_ to request
   project access.  **Provide a clear reason for your request.**
#. The principal investigator (PI) of the project must approve your
   project request.  They will be automatically notified and regularly
   reminded of open requests.
#. Once your project request is approved, a welcome email will be sent
   to you.

Requesting access to MSU-HPC systems
====================================

The Hercules and Orion systems comprise MSU-HPC, managed by
Mississippi State University. Follow these steps to get an Account for
MSU-HPC.

General Access Requirements
---------------------------

- All users, regardless of citizenship, follow the same process to
   receive MSU-HPC access.
- NOAA's RDHPCS users will need to use MSUâ€™s HPC Account Management
   System and Process. RDHPCS Portfolio Managers have access to MSU's
   Account Management Tool.
- The Portfolio Manager (PfM) must have allocations to use the MSU-HPC
   system.
- MSU's Account Management system requires user
   authentication. Principal Investigators (PIs) and Portfolio
   Managers must maintain an active MSU account to manage their
   projects online.

 .. note::

   The designated PI or Portfolio Manager must request that a
   MSU user account be created and the user assigned to their project.


Complete the following steps for MSU-HPC access.

- Collaborate with a NOAA research lab and be associated with an
  active NOAA research project. Each project has an assigned PI who is
  responsible for the project and the project members. The PI or PfM
  requests the project assignment and account creation.
- New user completes NOAA account request form.
- New user receives an email from MSU to change password, complete
  required training, and setup the Duo dual-factor authentication.
- Within three days, the user changes their password.
- The user completes required training.
- The user sets up the Duo App on their device.

The User now has login access to MSU-HPC.

.. note::

   A PfM PI who loses MSU account access must issue a help
   request. Send email to rdhpcs.orion.help@noaa.gov to open an OTRS
   ticket. A new user who has any issues with completing MSU process,
   should send email to rdhpcs.orion.help@noaa.gov to open a help
   ticket.

Account Activity Requirements: Suspension, Deactivation, Reactivation
=====================================================================

**Your NOAA RDHPCS account must be kept active by accessing the RDHPCS
at least once every 90 days.**

User accounts are suspended when they have been inactive for 90 days or more.
The user will be notified at their NOAA.gov address if their account has been
suspended, with instructions on reactivation. To reactivate your account, send
an email to: rdhpcs.aim.help@noaa.gov with the subject line: Reactivate
First.Last. This creates an OTRS ticket to reactivate the account.

Depending on the length of account suspension, there may be additional
steps to fully reactivate your account:

.. topic:: Reactivate within seven days

   If you reactivate your account within seven days, your RSA token is
   re-enabled at the same time. Once your account and token are
   re-enabled, you may log into your respective resource and project.

.. topic:: Reactivate after seven days

   If your account has been suspended for more than seven days and you
   had a software token, you must apply for a new token using the
   `Account Information Management`_ website.


Deactivated Accounts
--------------------

If your account remains suspended for more than 270 days, it will be
deactivated and lose all project associations.  You will need to
reapply for NOAA RDHPCS access.

Request a New Allocation or Project
===================================

Allocation requests currently flow via Helpdesk requests.  Send an
email to the appropriate :ref:`HPCS-specific help address
<getting_help>`.



Projects can be requested via the `Account Information Management`_
website.


Common Access Card (CAC)
========================

The Common Access Card (CAC) is another means of access to RDHPCS
resources for both Web and SSH access. To obtain a CAC, work with your
local admin services team as they need to start the application
process.  Some labs can issue CACs on-site, otherwise you will have to
visit a RAPIDS site. The site locator website is `ID Card Office
Online <https://idco.dmdc.osd.mil/idco/>`_.  SSH logins with a CAC
require additional software.
