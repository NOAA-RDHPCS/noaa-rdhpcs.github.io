Accessing RDHPCS Systems
************************

There are five NOAA RDHPCS systems and one external system available to the user community:

- Gaea
- Hera
- Niagara
- Jet
- Orion (MSU - external)

.. _aim_access:

AIM Access
----------
Access to RDHPCS systems depends on your assigned project(s). To request access to a project, please go to: `AIM <https://aim.rdhpcs.noaa.gov>`__

For MSU-HPC access, see `<https://noaa-rdhpcs.github.io/systems/MSU-HPC_user_guide.html#account-management MSU Account Management>`__

You can authenticate to RDHPCS (Internal Systems) using either CAC/PIV, or RSA Token.
Additionally, X.509 certificates are used within
RDHPCS to authenticate between resources. The X.509 certificates are
created using a user-defined pass-phrase. A validated certificate stays
valid for a set period of time (30 days). You do not have to re-validate
your certificate every time you login to the system.

.. _common_access_card_cac:

Common Access Card (CAC)
------------------------

| RDHPCS users with a CAC who are logging in from Windows, Mac, or Linux
  workstation/laptop are required to use CAC login.
| See CAC instructions `<https://noaa-rdhpcs.github.io/logging_in/index.html#connecting-with-a-cac here.>`_

.. _updating_or_renewing_cac_information_in_aim:

Updating or Renewing CAC Information in AIM
-------------------------------------------

AIM uses the NOAA single user sign-on. Proceed through the prompts and sign in with your NEMS
credentials.

AIM - Auto-update of CAC Entry
------------------------------

IMPACTS: ONLY RDHPCS Users with a NOAA-issued CAC.

RDHPCS Account Management collects CAC-related information from each user within AIM.
AIM  automatically detecst and updates CAC-related information to your AIM record. 

RDHPCS Account Management requests that you log into AIM to update
your CAC information. Navigate to `AIM <https://aim.rdhpcs.noaa.gov>`__
and authenticate via SSO using your CAC if prompted.

When you enter the site, the **Updated CAC detected. Information Updated**
message appears at the top of your screen if your CAC needs to be
updated. After you've done so, the AIM home page will appear, with the message, **Current CAC cn
detected**.

Send email to rdhpcs.aim.help@noaa.gov if you have issues or questions.

.. Note:: 
   With current CAC information on file, you should authenticate into RDHPCS with CAC as your primary means. If you need assistance with authenticating via CAC, please visit: `CAC Login 
   
   
   `<https://noaa-rdhpcs.github.io/logging_in/index.html#connecting-with-a-cac>`_

.. _rsa_token:


RSA Token Login
---------------

| RDHPCS users without a CAC log in via their current
  RSA token. Alternatively, any RDHPCS user who has a CAC but is having
  problems with their login via CAC, is authorized to login via RSA
  token while they work through their technical issues.
| Please see instructions here: `RSA Token
  Login <https://rdhpcs-common-docs.rdhpcs.noaa.gov/wiki/index.php/RSA_Login>`__

  
After you have been added to your first project, you will need to either initialize your RSA software token or enable your hardware token.


RSA Software Token Activation
-----------------------------

#. Email rdhpcs.aim.help@noaa.gov to open an OTRS ticket. Use the subject line: Token for New Device - First.Last.
#. Go to `<https://aim.rdhpcs.noaa.gov/ AIM>`_. Click **Make a request for an RSA token**, fill out the form and submit. When that form is received, you'll receive email including a URL and activation code. Open that URL from your device and submit the activation code.


.. _rsa_hardware_token_activation:

RSA Hardware Token Activation
-----------------------------

Submit an OTRS ticket.  Send email to rdhpcs.aim.help@noaa.gov, using **Enable token** as the subject. Once the hardware token is enabled, you will receive email with  to set your token pin.

.. _other_authentications:

Other Authentications
---------------------

Your current RSA token will be used for all other RDHPCS authentications
(sudo to role accounts, attended data transfers, x2go, etcâ€¦)


.. _new_device___software_tokens:


****************************
New Device - Software tokens
****************************

When you acquire a new device, follow this three-step process to add an RSA software token:

#. Email rdhpcs.aim.help@noaa.gov to open an OTRS ticket. Use the subject line: Token for New Device - First.Last.
#. Go to `<https://aim.rdhpcs.noaa.gov/ AIM>`_. Click **Make a request for an RSA token**, fill out the form, submit. When that form is received, you'll receive email including a URL and activation code. Open that URL from your device and submit the activation code.
#. When the software token is working on your new phone, delete the token from your old device.


**************************************
Suspension, Deactivation, Reactivation
**************************************

A user account is suspended when it has been inactive for over 90 days. The user will be notified when the account has been suspended. 
To re-activate your account, submit an OTRS ticket. Send an email to rdhpcs.aim.help@noaa.gov with the subject Reactivate User.Name. You will be notified when your account has been reactivated. A returning user maintains access to all projects.

**Reactivate within seven days**
If you reactivate your account within seven days, your token is re-enabled at the same time. Once your account and token are re-enabled, you may log into your respective resource and project.

**Reactivate after seven days**
If your account has been suspended for more than seven days and you had a software token, you must apply for a new token. Visiting AIM (Account Information Management) and select Make a Request for an RSA Token. Complete the form and Submit.

Once your account has been reactivated and your token has been re-enabled, you will be required to set a new PIN only if you have a software token. Then you will be able to lot into your respective resource and project.

**Deactivated Accounts**
If your account remains suspended for more than 180 days, the account is deactivated. If your account is deactivated, you will be handled as a new user. 

Go to `<https://aim.rdhpcs.noaa.gov/ AIM>`_ to apply for the rdhpcs project. Click on the "Request new access to a project" link. When you are fully approved for the rdhpcs project, you will be emailed further instructions. 

.. Note::

   Deactivation will reset your default shell to /bin/bash.  If you wish it to be anything else, log into AIM at the link below, click on the "View your information in the system, update the Sponsoring Organization" link. Scroll down to the section that displays your "Default shell" and change it, then scroll down to the bottom of the page and hit the "Submit changes" button.

For best use of resources and availability, the preferred approach is to install the SecurID app on a smart phone for token generation. Hardware tokens are available on request.

See `<https://rdhpcs-common-docs.rdhpcs.noaa.gov/wiki/index.php/New_User_Software_Token New User Software Token>`_ and `<https://rdhpcs-common-docs.rdhpcs.noaa.gov/wiki/index.php/New_User_Hardware_Token New User Hardware Token>`_ for details.

*************
Role Accounts
*************

A role account is a user account shared with one or more users as members, such that all group members share the account equally via the use of `sudo`, typically for the unified use of a project. Role accounts must have a name that reflects their project association or function.
All changes to a role account must be submitted by the role account Principal Investigator (PI) via OTRS ticket. Send email to rdhpcs.aim.help@noaa.gov with the subject line: Role account changes - first.last (role account name).

Accessing a Role Account
------------------------
You can access any role account if you are a member of the account. Use sudo with your RSA token to gain access. For example:

   
 .. code-block:: shell

   jsmith# sudo su - roleuser
   Access is via First.Last username only. Enter RSA PASSCODE:
   bash-4.1$
   bash-4.1$ whoami
   roleuser
   bash-4.1$

Your RSA passcode is your PIN+Token code.

**X Applications With Role Accounts**
If you are planning to use X utilities with role accounts, you should use the xsudo utility to switch to the role account instead of using the "sudo" command directly. You need to explicitly set the DISPLAY environment variable after doing the xsudo to the role account. So for example, if you want to use role.rap-chem role account and would like the ability to use X applications:

1. Note the DISPLAY environment variable in your current session before doing the xsudo to the role account:

.. code-block:: shell


   echo $DISPLAY

2. Use the xsudo command to switch to the role account:

.. code-block:: shell

   xsudo role.rap-chem

3. Set the DISPLAY environment variable to the value you obtained above just before doing xsudo; (please note that the next command you use depends on your shell):

.. code-block:: shell


   export DISPLAY=localhost:14.0         # for bash like shells
   setenv DISPLAY localhost:14.0         # for csh like shells

This will enable your X applications. 

**Using CRON with Role Accounts**
Since Role accounts are  shared by multiple users in a project, the project members need a way to know which member is responsible for which section of the cron entries. The person responsible for the section of a cron entry of a role account should use the following guidelines:

At the beginning of the section:

- Add a comment about the who is adding these cron entries
- Add a comment about when this entry was added
- Add a comment about an end date if applicable
- Add other comments as needed to document the purpose
- Add a "MAILTO=First.Last@noaa.gov" at the beginning of the section
- Add a "MAILTO=" at the end of the section so that whoever is responsible for the next section sets their own MAILTO filed.

.. note::

   Without the MAILTO directive, any errors/logs from the cron commands end up getting lost and one may never know there was a problem/failure!

***************************
Request Additional Projects
***************************

These are instructions for current RDHPCS users on an active project who need to request access to an additional project resource on Jet, Hera, Gaea, or Niagara.

#. Go to `<https://aim.rdhpcs.noaa.gov/ AIM>`_.
#. Select **Request new access to a project**.
#. Select the project from the dropdown list. Note that system access (Jet/Hera/Gaea/Niagara) is determined by project.
#. Add justification for requesting project access
#. Submit the request

Approvals needed: PI, HR, ISSO

Your request will automatically be approved from the HR and ISSO roles because you are a current user. You'll need actual approval from the PI of the project. Once that approval is submitted, your request will be considered fully approved and various admins will configure your access to the project. Once that is done, you will receive an aproval email from Account Management and you will be able to access the project.


**Projects not listed?**

If you have been advised to apply for a project that is not listed in AIM, first verify the project name with your Project team.. If the project name is correct, email RDHPCS.AIM.help@NOAA.gov to contact Account Management for assistance. 

If you have further questions, send email to rdhpcs.aim.help@noaa.gov for assistance.


*******************
RDHPCS Certificates
*******************

When a user first logs into a R&D HPC system, a one-year master certificate must be generated. On the next login, after the master certificate is signed, a 30-day proxy certificate is generated. Every future login renews the 30-day proxy certificate.

**Master Certificate:** The master certificate is valid across all bastions, for one year from date of creation. After one year the master certificate will need to be renewed. When it expires, any related proxy certificate expires as well.

**Proxy Certificate:** The proxy certificate is local to each bastion, is valid for 30 days and is renewed every time you login to each bastion. If you do not log in at least once every 30 days to each bastion, the proxy certificate will expire on that bastion. To renew your certificate, you will have to log in to the bastion and enter your master certificate passphrase. This will renew the proxy certificate, as usual, for 30 days.


Generating a Master Certificate
-------------------------------

1. Prepare your Master Certificate Passphrase

A passphrase must consist of at least three separate words and be at least 30 characters in length.
You will be prompted for you Master Certificate Passphrase from time to time. Therefore, your certificate passphrase should be something you can remember. For example: "G0 Down The 4lley & Yell Fi$h ." Notice that this passphrase is made more complex by the use of numbers in place of look-alike letters and the use or omission of spaces.

2. Create your Passphrase

Log into the system with your username (User.Name). The system will prompt you to create your master certificate passphrase. Your master certificate must be signed by the system before further access is allowed. This takes approximately fifteen minutes. You will receive an email stating that your certificate has been signed. After you receive the notification, please wait one hour before attempting to sign on to any resource. Following the waiting period, login with your username (User.Name) as usual.
You will be prompted for your master certificate passphrase. Enter the passphrase that you created with your master certificate, and your proxy will be renewed. After this step, you will only need your master certificate passphrase if your proxy completely expires (after 30 days).
Resetting Master Certificate Passphrase

.. note::
   You will have to renew your Master Certificate annually. About a month before it expires, you will be prompted to renew your master certificate, with a Y/N option. When you renew the master certificate, you may have to wait for one day before you can log in again. Plan ahead for a time when you can be offline for up to a day, and choose that time to renew the Master Certificate.

Resetting your Master Certificate Passphrase
--------------------------------------------

If you do not remember your Master Certificate passphrase, it can be reset. First check the guidance in the Prepare your Master Certificate Passphrase section, and choose an appropriate passphrase. Then follow the instructions below:

Hit Enter 4 times. The system will ask: "Have you forgotten your master certificate passphrase?" Answer "Yes".
Answer the questions, then enter the new master certificate passphrase at the prompt.
Once the new master certificate has been created, it will automatically be signed by the system. You will receive an email, confirming that the certificate has been signed. Wait for an hour, then sign into the system. When you are prompted for the Master Certificate passphrase, enter your new passphrase.

If you have further issues, submit an RDHPCS help ticket. Send an email to rdhpcs.aim.help@noaa.gov with the subject Master Certificate Passphrase.

Getting Access
--------------

This figure is an overview of the timeline and process for system access. 

.. image:: /images/access1.png

Once you have a NOAA.gov email address, you can request an RDHPCS account. 
Visit the `Account Information Management (AIM) website <https://aim.rdhpcs.noaa.gov>`_ and  request access to the RDHPCS project.  Log into AIM using your NOAA email credentials, review your profile for accuracy, and request the RDHPCS project.

.. image:: /images/AIM2.png

Once this request is approved, you will receive an email containing instructions about your next steps. These include requesting access to further projects and completing the RSA token request form.  Confer with your supervisor and colleagues to identify the  project(s) to request.


RSA Software Token
------------------

RSA software tokens provide two factor authentication (2FA) for NOAA RDHPCS systems for SSH access. When youâ€™re assigned to your first project, the RSA token form will be used to assign your software token. Your RSA token will include instructions about how to initialize it. You can find more information on RSA tokens here: Logging in - rdhpcs-common-docs (noaa.gov). 

.. NOTE::

     If you donâ€™t have a smartphone, you can request an RSA hardware token. The activation process is found here: `New User Activation <https://rdhpcs-common-docs.rdhpcs.noaa.gov/wiki/index.php/New_User_Activation#RSA_Token_Activation>`_.  RSA software tokens are preferred.


CAC Access
----------

The Common Access Card (CAC), is the preferred means of access to RDHPCS resources for both Web and SSH access. To obtain a CAC, work with your local admin services team as they need to start the application process.  Some labs can issue CACs on-site, otherwise you will have to visit a RAPIDS site. The site locator website is `ID Card Office Online <https://idco.dmdc.osd.mil/idco/locator>`_.  SSH logins with a CAC require additional software.


Accessing the RDHPCS Systems
----------------------------

.. NOTE::

   To access a system, you must be on a project assigned to that system.

On-Premise RDHPCS systems (Gaea, Hera, Jet, Niagara, PPAN) are accessed via SSH.  See the following pages for detailed instructions:

* `RSA logins <https://rdhpcs-common-docs.rdhpcs.noaa.gov/wiki/index.php/RSA_Login>`_
* `CAC logins <https://rdhpcs-common-docs.rdhpcs.noaa.gov/wiki/index.php/CAC_Login>`_

MSU systems (Orion, Hercules) are accessed via SSH or OpenOnDemand. See `Orion login: <https://oriondocs.rdhpcs.noaa.gov/wiki/index.php/Logging_in>`_ for detailed instructions.

Cloud RDHPCS platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP) are accessed via ParallelWorks in a web browser.  Login `here. <https://noaa.parallel.works/log>`_

**Cloud Computing**

The Cloud Platform allows RDHPCS users to create a high-performance computational cluster on a cloud-based platform (AWS, Azure or GCP) with resources that are appropriate for specific processing tasks. Cloud access is mediated through the Parallel Works application. An overview of the Cloud workflow, and links to detailed instructions, can be found in `Cloud Computing User Information. <https://clouddocs.rdhpcs.noaa.gov/wiki/index.php/Cloud_Computing_User_Information>`_

Role Accounts
-------------
A role account is a user account shared with one or more users as members. All group members share the account equally via the use of `sudo`, typically for the unified use of a project. The role accounts name should reflects their project association or function.

You can access any role account if you are a member of the account. Use sudo with your RSA token to gain access.

Any changes to a role account must be submitted by the role account Principal Investigator (PI) via OTRS ticket. Send email to rdhpcs.aim.help@noaa.gov with the subject line: Role account changes - first.last (role account name).

**************************
First Time RSA token Login
**************************

.. note::

      If you are using a PC, install `PuTTY <https://www.putty.org/>`__ prior to logging in for the first time. Mac and Linux users will user a terminal to login.

After you have been added to your first project, you will need to either initialize your RSA software token or enable your hardware token.

**RSA software token:** Please follow the instructions contained in
the `RSA Software Token USER Instructions <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-UMv1K62nQkKS0etbuLsXHZE2KBtjLl0/edit>`__.

**RSA hardware token:** Submit an OTRS ticket. Send an
email to rdhpcs.aim.help@noaa.gov using the subject line: Enable token.
You will be sent an email once your hardware token has been enabled with
instructions about how to set your token pin.


**********************************************
Overview: Getting an Internal Account - RDHPCS
**********************************************

The following steps must be completed before you receive an RDHPCS account.


1. Security Investigation: An inquiry into a person's identifiable character traits and conduct. You must undergo the appropriate type of suitability check/security including
-  favorable background investigation, with an FBI fingerprint check
-  Department of Commerce public trust security investigation. This can take 6-12 weeks

2. Obtain a valid @noaa.gov email address your NOAA IT department you are associated with. Use your NOAA email address to communicate regarding all NOAA issues. Note that you may have a NOAA email account prior to concluding the security review.
 
3. NOAA IT Security Awareness Training: An annual MANDATORY requirement
for all NOAA employees, contractors, and temporary personnel. 

4. RDHPCS Account Request: Request Access to vetting project RDHPCS.
- Navigate to AIM and submit a request to be added as a New User to the RDHPCS (vetting) project.  RDHPCS is an AIM-only project to verify account details.
-  Once you have been approved for vetting project RDHPCS, request membership to the project(s)as direced by your PI(s) or PfM(s). 

5. Request a RSA token.
-  Once you are fully approved you will receive an email with directions to initialize your RSA token and log on.

Currently AIM manages and maintains the following functionality on Niagara, Gaea,Hera, and Jet RDHPCS compute resources:

*  user information.
*  project information and membership.
*  role account information and membership.


***********************************************
Overview: Getting an External Account - MSU-HPC
***********************************************

The Hercules and Orion systems comprise MSU-HPC, managed by Mississippi State University. Follow these steps to get an Account for MSU-HPC.

General Access Requirements
---------------------------

-  All users, regardless of citizenship, follow the same process to
   receive MSU-HPC access.
-  NOAA's RDHPCS users will need to use MSUâ€™s HPC Account Management
   System and Process. RDHPCS Portfolio Managers have access to MSU's Account Management Tool.
-  The PfM must have allocations to use the MSU-HPC system.
-  MSU's Account Management system requires user authentication. PIs and
   Portfolio Managers must maintain an active MSU account to manage their projects online.

 .. note::

   The designated PI or Portfolio Manager (PfM) must request that a MSU user account be created and the user assigned to their project.


Complete the following steps for MSU-HPC access.
   -  Collaborate with a NOAA research lab and be associated with an active NOAA research project. Each project has an assigned Principal Investigator (PI) who is responsible for the project and the project members. The PI or PfM requests both project assignment and account creation.
   -  New user completes NOAA account request form.
   -  New user receives an email from MSU to change password, complete
      required training, and setup the Duo dual-factor authentication.
   -  Within three days, the user changes their password.
   -  The user completes required training.
   -  The user sets up the Duo App on their device.

The User now has login access to MSU-HPC.

.. note::

   A Portfolio Manager or PI who loses MSU account access must issue a help request. Send email to rdhpcs.orion.help@noaa.gov to open an OTRS ticket.
   A new user who has any issues with completing MSU process, should send email to rdhpcs.orion.help@noaa.gov to open a help ticket.
