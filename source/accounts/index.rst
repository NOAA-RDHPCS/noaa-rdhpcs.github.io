   System maintenance will affect access to RDHPCS systems. Check the  `RDHPCS Maintenance Downtime Calendar <https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/1/r?cid=bm9hYS5nb3ZfZjFnZ3U0M3RtOWxmZWVnNDV0NTlhMDYzY3NAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ>`__.

Account Process Overview
========================

This figure is an overview of the timeline and process for system access.

.. image:: /images/access1.png

Once you have a NOAA.gov email address, you can request an RDHPCS account.
Visit the `Account Information Management (AIM) website <https://aim.rdhpcs.noaa.gov>`__ and  request access to the RDHPCS project.  Log into AIM using your NOAA email credentials, review your profile for accuracy, and request the RDHPCS project.

.. image:: /images/AIM2.png

Once this request is approved, you will receive an email containing instructions about your next steps. These include requesting access to further projects and completing the RSA token request form.  Confer with your supervisor and colleagues to identify the  project(s) to request.

RSA Software Token
==================

RSA software tokens provide two factor authentication (2FA) for NOAA RDHPCS systems for SSH access. When you’re assigned to your first project, the RSA token form will be used to assign your software token. Your RSA token will include instructions about how to initialize it. You can find more information on RSA tokens here: Logging in - rdhpcs-common-docs (noaa.gov).

.. note::

     If you don’t have a smartphone, you can request an RSA hardware token. The activation process is found here: `New User Activation <https://rdhpcs-common-docs.rdhpcs.noaa.gov/wiki/index.php/New_User_Activation#RSA_Token_Activation>`__.  RSA software tokens are preferred.

CAC Access
==========

The Common Access Card (CAC), is the preferred means of access to RDHPCS resources for both Web and SSH access. To obtain a CAC, work with your local admin services team as they need to start the application process.  Some labs can issue CACs on-site, otherwise you will have to visit a RAPIDS site. The site locator website is `ID Card Office Online <https://idco.dmdc.osd.mil/idco/locator>`_.  SSH logins with a CAC require additional software.

Accessing the Systems
=====================

.. NOTE::

   To access a system, you must be on a project assigned to that system.

On-Premise RDHPCS systems (Gaea, Hera, Jet, Niagara, PPAN) are accessed via SSH.  See the following pages for detailed instructions:

* `RSA logins <https://rdhpcs-common-docs.rdhpcs.noaa.gov/wiki/index.php/RSA_Login>`__
* `CAC logins <https://rdhpcs-common-docs.rdhpcs.noaa.gov/wiki/index.php/CAC_Login>`__

MSU systems (Orion, Hercules) are accessed via SSH or OpenOnDemand. See `Orion login: <https://oriondocs.rdhpcs.noaa.gov/wiki/index.php/Logging_in>`__ for detailed instructions.

Cloud RDHPCS platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP) are accessed via `NOAA ParallelWorks <https://noaa.parallel.works>`__ via a web browser.

**Cloud Computing**

The Cloud Platform allows RDHPCS users to create a high-performance computational cluster on a cloud-based platform (AWS, Azure or GCP) with resources that are appropriate for specific processing tasks. Cloud access is mediated through the Parallel Works application. An overview of the Cloud workflow, and links to detailed instructions, can be found in `Cloud Computing User Information. <https://clouddocs.rdhpcs.noaa.gov/wiki/index.php/Cloud_Computing_User_Information>`_


Accessing RDHPCS Systems
========================

First Time RSA token Login
--------------------------

.. note::

   If you are using a PC, please install `PuTTY <https://www.putty.org/>`__
   prior to logging in for the first time. Mac and Linux users will user a
   terminal to login.

After you have been added to your first project, you will need to either
initialize your RSA software token or enable your hardware token.

Role Accounts
-------------

A role account is a user account shared with one or more users as members. All group members share the account equally via the use of `sudo`, typically for the unified use of a project. The role accounts name should reflects their project association or function.

You can access any role account if you are a member of the account. Use sudo with your RSA token to gain access.

Any changes to a role account must be submitted by the role account Principal Investigator (PI) via OTRS ticket. Send email to rdhpcs.aim.help@noaa.gov with the subject line: Role account changes - first.last (role account name).

New Device - Software tokens
----------------------------

When you acquire a new device, follow this three-step process to add an RSA software token:
#. Submit an OTRS ticket by emailing rdhpcs.aim.help@noaa.gov. Use the subject line: Token for New Device- First.Last.
#. Go to AIM, click on the "Make a request for an RSA token" link, fill out the form, and hit the submit button. When that form is received, you'll receive email that includes a URL and activation code. Open that URL from your device and submit the activation code.
#. When the software token is working on your new phone, delete the token from your old device.

Accessing RDHPCS Systems
------------------------

.. caution::

   **READ BEFORE CONTINUING:** Please log onto AIM (using ICAM credentials)
   and confirm that ALL your account information is up-to-date. If you
   recently were issued a new CAC OR renewed your CAC, please check that
   the CAC information in AIM matches your current CAC. For more
   information on updating the CAC, please see below.

We currently have four (4) NOAA RDHPCS systems and one external system
available to the user community:
-  Gaea
-  Hera
-  Niagara
-  Jet
-  Orion (MSU - external)

.. _aim_access:

AIM Access
----------

Access to RDHPCS systems depends on your assigned project(s). To request access
to a project, please go to: `AIM <https://aim.rdhpcs.noaa.gov>`__

For Orion access, see `Logging Into Orion
<https://oriondocs.rdhpcs.noaa.gov/wiki/index.php/Logging_in>`__

Two options exist for authenticating to RDHPCS (Internal Systems),
CAC/PIV and RSA Token. Additionally, X.509 certificates are used within
RDHPCS to authenticate between resources. The X.509 certificates are
created using a user-defined pass-phrase. A validated certificate stays
valid for a set period of time (30 days). You do not have to re-validate
your certificate every time you login to the system.

AIM - Auto-update of CAC Entry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

IMPACTS: ONLY RDHPCS Users with a NOAA-issued CAC.

RDHPCS Account Management has worked to make improvements in the
function to collect CAC-related information from each user within AIM.
Recent updates to AIM now allow automatic detection and update of
CAC-related information to your respective AIM record. Previously,
RDHPCS users had to manually update their CAC.

RDHPCS Account Management is requesting that you log into AIM to update your CAC
information. Please navigate to the `AIM website
<https://aim.rdhpcs.noaa.gov>`__ and authenticate via SSO using your CAC. Please
note that you might not always be asked to authenticate with CAC when logging
onto the AIM site.

When you enter the site, the “Updated CAC detected. Information Updated”
message appears at the top of your screen if your CAC needs to be
updated.

.. note::

   If your CAC does not need to be updated, you will not receive this message.
   It might be worth noting, if your current CAC was updated within AIM or if
   users do not have a CAC they will not experience this event.

If you experience any issues or have questions, please contact:
rdhpcs.aim.help@noaa.gov

After your CAC has been updated, the AIM home page will appear and in
the upper left-hand corner, you will see the message, “Current CAC cn
detected.”

Suspension, Deactivation, Reactivation
--------------------------------------

A user account is suspended when it has been inactive for over 90 days. The user will be notified when the account has been suspended.
To re-activate your account, submit an OTRS ticket. Send an email to rdhpcs.aim.help@noaa.gov with the subject Reactivate User.Name. You will be notified when your account has been reactivated. A returning user maintains access to all projects.

**Reactivate within seven days**
If you reactivate your account within seven days, your token is re-enabled at the same time. Once your account and token are re-enabled, you may log into your respective resource and project.

**Reactivate after seven days**
If your account has been suspended for more than seven days and you had a software token, you must apply for a new token. Visiting AIM (Account Information Management) and select Make a Request for an RSA Token. Complete the form and Submit.

Once your account has been reactivated and your token has been re-enabled, you will be required to set a new PIN only if you have a software token. Then you will be able to lot into your respective resource and project.

**Deactivated Accounts**
If your account remains suspended for more than 180 days, the account is deactivated. If your account is deactivated, you will be handled as a new user.

Go to `<https://aim.rdhpcs.noaa.gov/ AIM>`_ to apply for the rdhpcs project. Click on the "Request new access to a project" link. When you are fully approved for the rdhpcs project, you will be emailed further instructions.

.. Note.. code-block:: shell


   Deactivation will reset your default shell to /bin/bash.  If you wish it to be anything else, log into AIM at the link below, click on the "View your information in the system, update the Sponsoring Organization" link. Scroll down to the section that displays your "Default shell" and change it, then scroll down to the bottom of the page and hit the "Submit changes" button.

For best use of resources and availability, the preferred approach is to install the SecurID app on a smart phone for token generation. Hardware tokens are available on request.

See `<https://rdhpcs-common-docs.rdhpcs.noaa.gov/wiki/index.php/New_User_Software_Token New User Software Token>`_ and `<https://rdhpcs-common-docs.rdhpcs.noaa.gov/wiki/index.php/New_User_Hardware_Token New User Hardware Token>`_ for details.

Role Accounts
-------------

A role account is a user account shared with one or more users as members, such that all group members share the account equally via the use of `sudo`, typically for the unified use of a project. Role accounts must have a name that reflects their project association or function.
All changes to a role account must be submitted by the role account Principal Investigator (PI) via OTRS ticket. Send email to rdhpcs.aim.help@noaa.gov with the subject line: Role account changes - first.last (role account name).

**Accessing a Role Account**
You can access any role account if you are a member of the account. Use sudo with your RSA token to gain access. For example:

.. code-block.. code-block:: shell

 .. code-block:: shell

   jsmith# sudo su - roleuser
   Access is via First.Last username only. Enter RSA PASSCODE:
   bash-4.1$
   bash-4.1$ whoami
   roleuser
   bash-4.1$

Your RSA passcode is your PIN+Token code.

**X Applications With Role Accounts**
If you are planning to use X utilities with role accounts, you should use the xsudo utility to switch to the role account instead of using the "sudo" command directly. You need to explicitly set the DISPLAY environment variable after doing the xsudo to the role account. So for example, if you want to use role.rap-chem role account and would like the ability to use X applications:

1. Note the DISPLAY environment variable in your current session before doing the xsudo to the role account:

.. code-block:: shell

   echo $DISPLAY

2. Use the xsudo command to switch to the role account:

.. code-block:: shell

   xsudo role.rap-chem

3. Set the DISPLAY environment variable to the value you obtained above just before doing xsudo; (please note that the next command you use depends on your shell):

.. code-block:: shell

   export DISPLAY=localhost:14.0         # for bash like shells
   setenv DISPLAY localhost:14.0         # for csh like shells

This will enable your X applications.

**Using CRON with Role Accounts**
Since Role accounts are  shared by multiple users in a project, the project members need a way to know which member is responsible for which section of the cron entries. The person responsible for the section of a cron entry of a role account should use the following guidelines:

At the beginning of the section:

- Add a comment about the who is adding these cron entries
- Add a comment about when this entry was added
- Add a comment about an end date if applicable
- Add other comments as needed to document the purpose
- Add a "MAILTO=First.Last@noaa.gov" at the beginning of the section
- Add a "MAILTO=" at the end of the section so that whoever is responsible for the next section sets their own MAILTO filed.

.. note::

   Without the MAILTO directive, any errors/logs from the cron commands end up getting lost and one may never know there was a problem/failure!

Request Additional Projects
---------------------------

These are instructions for current RDHPCS users on an active project who need to request access to an additional project resource on Jet, Hera, Gaea, or Niagara.

#. Go to `<https://aim.rdhpcs.noaa.gov/ AIM>`_
#. Select the link "Request new access to a project"
#. Select the project from the dropdown list. Note that system access (Jet/Hera/Gaea/Niagara) is determined by project.
#. Add justification for requesting project access
#. Submit the request

Approvals needed: PI, HR, ISSO

After your request has been submitted, your request will be semi-auto approved from the HR and ISSO roles because you are a current user. The only approval that you'll need is from the PI of the project. Once that approval is submitted, your request will be considered fully approved and will pass through the hands of various admins who will configure your access to the project. Once that process has been completed, you will receive an email from Account Management stating that your request has been fully approved and you will be able to access the project.


**Projects not listed?**

If you have been advised to apply for a project that is not listed in AIM, please verify with your Project team that you have the correct project name. If you feel that the project name is correct, email RDHPCS.AIM.help@NOAA.gov to contact Account Management for assistance. This email will open a OTRS ticket that will be answered by an admin on the Account Management team.

Please contact the Help Desk via email if you have further questions, rdhpcs.aim.help@noaa.gov

RDHPCS certificates
===================

When a user first logs into a R&D HPC system, a one-year master certificate must be generated. On the next login, after the master certificate is signed, a 30-day proxy certificate is generated. Every future login renews the 30-day proxy certificate.

**Master Certificate:** The master certificate is valid across all bastions, for one year from date of creation. After one year the master certificate will need to be renewed. When it expires, any related proxy certificate expires as well.

**Proxy Certificate:** The proxy certificate is local to each bastion, is valid for 30 days and is renewed every time you login to each bastion. If you do not log in at least once every 30 days to each bastion, the proxy certificate will expire on that bastion. To renew your certificate, you will have to log in to the bastion and enter your master certificate passphrase. This will renew the proxy certificate, as usual, for 30 days.


Generating a Master Certificate
-------------------------------

1. Prepare your Master Certificate Passphrase

A passphrase must consist of at least three separate words and be at least 30 characters in length.
You will be prompted for you Master Certificate Passphrase from time to time. Therefore, your certificate passphrase should be something you can remember. For example: "G0 Down The 4lley & Yell Fi$h ." Notice that this passphrase is made more complex by the use of numbers in place of look-alike letters and the use or omission of spaces.

2. Create your Passphrase

Log into the system with your username (User.Name). The system will prompt you to create your master certificate passphrase. Your master certificate must be signed by the system before further access is allowed. This takes approximately fifteen minutes. You will receive an email stating that your certificate has been signed. After you receive the notification, please wait one hour before attempting to sign on to any resource. Following the waiting period, login with your username (User.Name) as usual.
You will be prompted for your master certificate passphrase. Enter the passphrase that you created with your master certificate, and your proxy will be renewed. After this step, you will only need your master certificate passphrase if your proxy completely expires (after 30 days).
Resetting Master Certificate Passphrase

.. note::
   You will have to renew your Master Certificate annually. About a month before it expires, you will be prompted to renew your master certificate, with a Y/N option. When you renew the master certificate, you may have to wait for one day before you can log in again. Plan ahead for a time when you can be offline for up to a day, and choose that time to renew the Master Certificate.


Resetting your Master Certificate Passphrase
--------------------------------------------

If you do not remember your Master Certificate passphrase, it can be reset. First check the guidance in the Prepare your Master Certificate Passphrase section, and choose an appropriate passphrase. Then follow the instructions below:

Hit Enter 4 times. The system will ask: "Have you forgotten your master certificate passphrase?" Answer "Yes".
Answer the questions, then enter the new master certificate passphrase at the prompt.
Once the new master certificate has been created, it will automatically be signed by the system. You will receive an email, confirming that the certificate has been signed. Wait for an hour, then sign into the system. When you are prompted for the Master Certificate passphrase, enter your new passphrase.

If you have further issues, submit an RDHPCS help ticket. Send an email to rdhpcs.aim.help@noaa.gov with the subject Master Certificate Passphrase.
