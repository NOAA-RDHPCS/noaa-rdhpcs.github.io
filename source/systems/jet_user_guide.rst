For decades, NOAA weather research has relied on High Performance
Computing to further its mission of developing leading edge weather
observation and prediction capabilities. This has been accomplished
both the development of leading edge software as well as the adoption
of cutting edge hardware technologies to push forward the envelope of
what is computationally feasible.

Intel Paragon was an early parallel system, delivered in 1991 and was
used for the development of a parallel RUC model. Researchers at GSL
also developed the Scalable Modeling System (SMS) to assist in the
parallelization of codes. To further development of parallel
programming standards GSL staff members participated in the
development of the MPI-1 and MPI-2 standards, which provided a common
basis for the parallel computational methods used today.

In 2000, GSL took delivery of an HPC system relying on a relatively
new concept, clustering. Very similar to a Beowulf cluster, the system
used off the shelf desktop servers with Myrinet a high-speed,
low-latency network interconnect. This system provided substantially
more performance that the traditional architectures available at the
time in a much more cost effective manner.

Now Jet refers to any of the clustered systems that have passed
through GSL since 2000 and are used to support NOAA Research and
Development High Performance Computing (RDHPC) requirements for GSL
and other NOAA offices, including the Hurricane Forecast Improvement
Project (HFIP) since 2009.

GPU Clusters
------------

GSL continues to research potentially disruptive, next generation HPC
technologies. Graphical Processing Units, GPUs, are traditionally used
for graphics and video gaming, but their design is applicable to
numerical modelling as well. Since their architecture is fundamentally
different from traditional CPUs, existing software usually does not
run without modification.

At GSL, we have been using GPU clusters since 2009 and are developing
new tools and techniques that will allow these systems to be used in
the future by scientists to solve tomorrow's weather and hurricane
prediction challenges.


About Modules
=============

Modules is a tool that is used to manage the use of softwarewhen
multiple versions are installed. For packages that arenot provided
with the OS (compilers, debuggers, MPI stacks,etc), we install so that
new versions to not overwrite oldversions. By default, no modules are
loaded. Therefore you must loadany modules that you wish to use. To
see what modules areavailable, run:

.. code-block:: shell

   # module avail

At a minimum you will want to load a compiler and an MPIstack:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ module load intel
   $ module load mvapich2

.. note::

   Since you have to do this explicitly (for now), you also have to
   do it in your job scripts. Or, you can put it in your `.profile`
   and make it permanent.

.. rubric:: Modules on Jet

The way to find the latest modules on Jet is to run module avail:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ module aval

to see the list of available modules for the compiler and the MPI
modules currently loaded.

.. code-block:: shell

   --------------------------------- /apps/lmod/lmod/modulefiles/Core ---------------------------------
   lmod/7.7.18    settarg/7.7.18

  Where:
   D:  Default Module

   Use "module spider" to find all possible modules.
   Use "module keyword key1 key2 ..." to search for all possible modules matching any of the "keys".

In the above, each module name represents a different package. In
cases where there are multiple versions of a package, one will be set
as a default. For example, for the intel compiler there are multiple
choices:

.. code-block:: shell

   intel/11.1.080    intel/12-12.1.4(default)    intel/12-12.1.5

So if you run:

.. code-block:: shell

   # module load intel

The default version will be loaded, in this case 12-12.1.4 If you want
to load a specific version, you can. We highly recommend you use the
system defaults unless something is not working or you need a
different feature. To load a specific version, specify the version
number.

.. code-block:: shell

   # module load intel/11.1.080    # module list   Currently Loaded Modulefiles:    1) intel/11.1.080

to a different version of the same module, you can either do
If you already have a particular module loaded and you want to switch

 .. code-block:: shell

   # module unload intel   # module load intel/11.1.080

or

 .. code-block:: shell

   # module switch intel intel/11.1.080

.. warning::

   When unloading modules, only unload those that you have loaded.
   The others are done automatically from master modules.

.. note::

   Modules is a work in progress, and we will be improving their uses
   and making which modules you load more clear.


Using Math Libraries
====================

The intel math kernel library (MKL) provides a wide variety of
optimized math libraries including "BLAS, LAPACK, ScaLAPACK, sparse
solvers, fast Fourier transforms, vector math, and more." Click the
link for `product documentation
<https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/onemkl/get-started-guide/2023-0/overview.html>`_

Below are provided several examples that should help most of
the users on our system.


.. rubric:: Location of MKL on Jet

**MKL** is specific to the version of the Intel compiler used. After
loading the compiler version you require, the variable **$MKLROOT**
will be defined that specifies the path to the MKL library. Use this
variable.

.. rubric:: Basic Linking with BLAS and LAPACK

To link with the mathematical libraries such as BLAS, LAPACK, and the
FFT routines, it is best to just add the following option to your link
line:

.. code-block:: shell

   -mkl=sequential

.. note::

   There is no lower case L in front of mkl. This will include all of
   the libraries you will need. The sequential option is important
   because by default Intel MKL will use threaded (OpenMP like)
   versions of the library. In MPI applications you rarely want to do
   this. Even if you are using OpenMP/MPI hybrids, only consider
   removing the sequential option if you want the actual math routines
   to be parallel, not the whole code (Ex: GFS uses OpenMP, but relies
   on sequential math routines, so you would want to use sequential
   for that code).

.. rubric:: Linking with FFT, and the FFTW interface

Intel provides highly optimized FFT routines within MKL. They are
documented in the `Intel math kernel library <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/onemkl/developer-reference-c/2024-1/fourier-transform-functions.html>`__.
While Intel has a specific interface (DFTI), we recommend that you use
the FFTW interface. `FFTW <http://www.fftw.org/>`__ is an open-source,
highly optimized FFT library, that supports many different platforms.
FFTW (specifically FFTW3 interface) can be supported on Intel, AMD,
and IBM Power architectures. IBM is even supporting the FFTW interface
through ESSL, meaning that using the FFTW3 interface will allow codes
to be portable across the NOAA architectures.

The best reference for the fftw interface can be found `here
<http://www.fftw.org/>`__. For Fortran, you need to include the
wrapper script **fftw3.f** in your source before using the functions.
Add the following statement:

.. code-block:: shell

   include 'fftw3.f'

In the appropriate place in your source code. When compiling, add:

.. code-block:: shell

    '-I$(MKLROOT)/include/fftw'

to your CFLAGS and/or FFLAGS. When linking, use the steps described
above.

.. rubric:: Linking with Scalapack

Linking with Scalapack is more complicated because it uses MPI. You
have to specify which version of the MPI library you are using when
linking with Scalapack. Examples are:

.. rubric:: Linking with Scalapack and mvapich

.. code-block:: shell

   LDFLAGS=-L$(MKLROOT)/lib/intel64 -lmkl_scalapack_lp64 -lmkl_blacs_lp64 -lmkl_intel_lp64 -lmkl_sequential -lmkl_core

.. rubric:: Linking with Scalapack and OpenMPI

.. code-block:: shell

   LDFLAGS=-L$(MKLROOT)/lib/intel64 -lmkl_scalapack_lp64 -lmkl_blacs_openmpi_lp64 -lmkl_intel_lp64 -lmkl_sequential -lmkl_core

In the example above, the variable `$(MKLROOT)` is used. Use this
variable name, not the explicit path for the Intel compiler.

.. rubric:: Linking math libraries with Portland Group

For the PGI compiler, all you need to do is specify the library name.

For blas:

.. code-block:: shell

   -lblas

For lapack:

.. code-block:: shell

   -llapack

Starting a Parallel Application
===============================

.. rubric:: Supported MPI Stacks

We currently support two MPI stacks on Jet, `Mvapich2
<https://mvapich.cse.ohio-state.edu/overview/>`__ and `OpenMPI
<http://www.open-mpi.org/>`__. We consider Mvapich2 our primary MPI
stack. OpenMPI is provided for software development and regression
testing. In our experience, Mvapich2 provides better performance
without requiring tuning. We do not have the depth of staff to fully
support multiple stacks, but we will try our best. If you feel you
need to use OpenMPI as your production stack, please send us a note
through `Help Requests
<https://rdhpcs-common-docs.rdhpcs.noaa.gov/wiki/index.php/Help_Requests>`__
and explain why so we can better understand your requirements.

.. rubric:: Load MPI Stacks Via Modules

The MPI libraries are compiler specific. Therefore a compiler must be
loaded first before the MPI stacks become visible.

.. code-block:: shell

   $ module load intel
   $ module avail

   ...
   ------------------------- /apps/Modules/default/modulefamilies/intel -- -------------------
   hdf4/4.2.7(default)      mvapich2/1.6 netcdf/3.6.3(default)    netcdf4/4.2.1.1(default)
   hdf5/1.8.9(default)      mvapich2/1.8(default)    netcdf4/4.2  openmpi/1.6.3(default)

You can see now that mvapich2 and openmpi available to be loaded. You
can load the module with command:

.. code-block:: shell

   # module load mvapich2

.. warning::

   Please use the default version of the MPI stack you require unless
   you are tracking down bugs or by request of the Jet Admin staff.

.. rubric:: Launching Jobs

On Jet, please use mpiexec. This is a wrapper script that sets up your
run environment to match your batch job and use process affinity
(which provides better performance).

.. code-block:: shell

   mpiexec -np $NUM_OF_RANKS

.. rubric:: Launching MPMD jobs

MPMD (multi-program, multi-data) programs are typically used for
coupled MPI jobs, for example oceans and atmosphere. Colons are used
to separate the requirements of each launch. For example:

.. code-block:: shell

   mpiexec -np 36 ./ocean.exe : -np 24 ./atm.exe

Of the 60 MPI ranks, the first 36 will be ocean.exe process, and the
last 24 will be the atm.exe process.

.. rubric:: MPI Library Specific Options

The MPI standard does not explicitly define how implementations are
done between the libraries. Therefore, a single call to mpiexec can
never be guaranteed to work across different libraries. Below are the
important differences between the the ones that we support.

.. rubric:: Passing Environment Variables

There are two methods to pass variables to MPI processes, global
(-genv) and local (-env). The global ones are applied to every
executable. The local ones are only applied to the executable
specified. The two methods are the same if the job launch is not MPMD.
If you need to pass different variables with different values to
different MPMD executables, use the local version. When using the
global versions you should put them before the -np specification as
that defines where the local parameters start.

To pass a variable with its value:

.. code-block:: shell

   -genv VARNAME=VAL

To pass multiple variables with values, list them all out:

.. code-block:: shell

   -genv VARNAME1=VAL1 -genv VARNAME2=VAL2

If the variables are already defined, then you can just pass the list
on the mpiexec line:

.. code-block:: shell

   -genvlist VARNAME1,VARNAME2

If you want to just pass the entire environment, you can just do:

.. code-block:: shell

   -genvall

..note ::
   This may have unintended consequences and may not work depending
   how large your environment is. We recommend you explicitly pass
   what you need to pass to the MPI processes.

If you need to pass different variables to different processes in an
MPMD configuration, an example of the syntax would be:

.. code-block:: shell

   mpiexec -np 4 -env OMP_NUM_THREADS=2 ./ocean.exe | -np 8 -env OMP_NUM_THREADS=3 ./atm.exe

.. rubric:: OpenMPI Specific Options

.. rubric:: Passing Environment Variables

The option -x is used to pass variables. To pass a variable with its
value:

.. code-block:: shell

   -x VARNAME=VAL

To pass the contents of an existing variable:

.. code-block:: shell

   -x VARNAME

To pass multiple variables:

.. code-block:: shell

   -x VARNAME1,VARNAME2=VAL2,VARNAME3

When comparing this to Mvapich2, these are all local definitions.
There is no way to pass a variable to all processes of an MPMD
application with a single usage of **-x**.



Policies and Best Practices
===========================

.. rubric:: Project Data Management

Project Data Management
This includes the High Performance File System
(HPFS, Scratch), HFS (Home File System), the HPSS HSMS (tape).

.. rubric:: Login (Front End) Node Usage Policy

Login (Front_End) Node Usage Policy in RDHPCS CommonDocs

.. rubric:: Cron Usage Policy

Cron Usage Policy in RDHPCS CommonDocs

.. rubric:: Maximum Job Length Policy

See the section
for maximum job length per partition and QOS. If you require jobs to
run longer than this, it is expected that you use checkpoint/restart
to save the state of your model. Then you can resubmit the job and
have it pickup where it left off. This policy has been developed over
a decade of different job patterns as a balance between user needs,
fairness within the system, and reducing risk of losing too many CPU
hours from failed jobs or system interruptions.

.. rubric:: /tmp Usage Policy

Every node in the Jet system has a /tmp directory. In most other
Unix/Linux systems, users use this space used for temporary files.
This generally works when the size of /tmp is somewhat similar to the
working space (like /home) on a traditional workstation.

However, Jet is not a workstation. The size of /tmp on Jet is much
smaller than the working space of the project directories. In many
cases, a typical file written in a project directory could be as large
as the entire /tmp space. On the compute nodes, the problem is worse.
The compute nodes have no disk, and the size of /tmp is on the order
of 1 GB.

For these reasons:

-  Users should refrain from using /tmp. The /tmp directory is for
   system tools and processes.
-  All users have project space, use that space for manipulating
   temporary files.

The /tmp filesystem can be faster for accessing small files there are
valid reasons to use /tmp for your processing. Only consider using
/tmp if:

-  The size of your files are less than a few MB
-  Your files will not be need after the process is done running

Please clean up your temporary files after you are done using them.

.. rubric:: Software Support Policy

Our goal is to enable science on any RDHPCS system. This often
includes installing additional software to improve the utility and
usefulness of the system.

.. rubric:: Systems Administrator Managed Software

The HPCS support staff is not an unlimited resource and since every
additional software package installed increases our effort level, we
have to evaluate each request. The systems administrators will take on
the responsibility of maintaining packages based on the usefulness of
the tool to the user community, their complexity of installation and
maintenance, as well as other factors.

-  If the package is a part of the current OS base (Redhat), these
   requests will *normally be honored*

One notable exception is for 32-bit applications. 32-bit support
requires a huge increase of installed packages which makes they system
images harder to maintain and secure. We expect all applications to
work in 64-bit mode.

-  If the package is available from the `EPEL repository
   <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL>`_, it is likely that we can
   install it unless it causes additional complexities. However, if
   EPEL stops supporting it, we may as well.
-  If the software is not a part of the Redhat or EPEL repositories,
   we can still consider it. Each request will be considered on a case
   by case basis based on the value to the community.

.. rubric:: Single-user Managed Software

Users are always free to install software packages and maintain them
in their home or project directories.

.. rubric:: "Contributor" Managed Software

We have one other method to support software on the system. As we
cannot be the experts of all system packages, we have to rely on the
community to help out to provide as much value from the system as
possible. To enable this, we have a user contributed software section.
The user will be given access to a system level directory in which
they can install software. We will make the minimal changes necessary
to allow access to the installed tool. Any questions from the help
system that we cannot answer will be forwarded to the package
maintainer.

If you wish to contribute a package to the system, please start a
system help ticket: :ref:`getting_help`


System Software
===============

.. rubric:: How Software is Organized Through Modules

Many software packages have compiler dependencies, and some also have
MPI stack dependencies. To ensure that the correct packages are
loaded, the module installation has been designed so that only valid
packages are presented to you. For example, there are multiple
versions of netcdf3, one for each compiler family we have. So when you
run module avail:

.. code-block:: shell

   # module avail

   ------------------------------ /apps/Modules/3.2.9/modulefil------------------------------------------------
   bbcp/12.01.30.01.0(default) hpssmodule-cvs      nulludunits/1.12.11
   cnvgrib/1.2.3(default)      intel/11.1.080  module-info     pgi/12.5-0(default)         udunits/2.1.24(default)
   cuda/4.2.9(default)         intel/12.1.4(default)       modules         rocoto/1.0.1(default)       use.own
   dot intel/12.1.5    ncl/6.0.0       szip/2.1        wgrib/1.8.1.0b(default)
   grads/2.0.1(default)        lahey/8.10b(default)        nco/4.1.0       totalview/8.9.2-2(default)  wgrib2/0.1.9.6a(default)

There is no option for netcdf3. However, after load a compiler, then
you have access to the packages that are dependent on that compiler.

.. code-block:: shell

The same method exists for packages that are dependent on both a
compiler and MPI stack. If you wanted to use parallel hdf5 or parallel
netcdf4, you would have to first specify the MPI stack you wanted to
use.

.. code-block:: shell

   [ctierney@fe8 ~]$ module avail

   -------------------------------------- /apps/Modules/default/modulefamilies/intel-mvapich2/1.8 ----------------------

.. rubric:: Environment Variables

For all packages on the system, environment variables have been set to
ensure consistency in their use. We have defined the following
variables for your use when using the different packages on the
system:

-  $NETCDF - Base directory of NetCDF3
-  $NETCDF4 - Base directory of NetCDF4
-  $NCO - Base directory of NCO
-  $HDF4 - Base directory of HDF4
-  $HDF5 - Base directory of HDF5
-  $UDUNITS - Base directory of Udunits
-  $SZIP - Base directory of szip
-  $NCARG_ROOT - Base directory of NCAR Graphics and NCL
-  $GEMPAK - Base directory of GEMPAK
-  $GEMLIB - Location of GEMPAK libraries
-  $CUDA - Base directory of Cuda
-  $GADDIR - Location of Grads libraries

When you are specifying the location of the libraries when compiling,
use the variable name. For example:

.. code-block:: shell

   icc mycode.c -o mycode -I$NETCDF/include -L$NETCDF/lib -lnetcdf

.. rubric:: User supported modules

Users who require access to packages not currently supported by the
HPC staff are welcome to submit requests through the help system to
install and support unique modules. To access these user supported
modules you must first update the module path to include the
/contrib/modulefiles. To access these additional modules execute the
following commands.

.. code-block:: shell

   $ module use /contrib/modulefiles
   $ module avail

   . . .

Using OpenMP and Hybrid OpenMP/MPI on Jet
=========================================

.. rubric:: Using OpenMP and Hybrid OpenMP/MPI on Jet

`OpenMP <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMP>`_ is a
programming extension for supporting parallel computing in Fortran and
C using shared memory. It is relative easy to parallelize code using
OpenMP. However, parallelization is restricted to a single node. As
any programming model, there can be tricks to make to write efficient
code.

We support OpenMP on Jet, however, it is infrequently used and we have
not figured out all the issues. If you want to use OpenMP, please
submit a `help request
<https://rdhpcs-common-docs.rdhpcs.noaa.gov/wikis/rdhpcs-common-docs/doku.php?id=submitting_help_request>`_
and let us know so we can keep track of the users interested in using
it.

.. rubric:: Compiling codes with OpenMP

For Intel, add the option '''-openmp'''. For Portland Group, add the
option '''-mp'''

.. rubric:: Specifying the Number of Threads to use

Depending on the compiler used, the the default number of threads to
use is different. Intel will use all the core available. For PGI, it
will default to using 1. It is best to always explicitly set what you
want. Use the OMP_NUM_THREADS variable to do this. Ex:

.. code-blocK:: shell

    setenv OMP_NUM_THREADS 4

The number you want to use would generally be the total available on a
node. See the [[system_information|System Information]] page for how
many cores there are on each system.

.. rubric:: Programming Tips for OpenMP ==

Do not use implicit array setting when initializing arrays in Fortran.
Since memory is not allocated until it is first used, there is no way
for the implicit statement to understand what to do. What this will
lead to is that your program won't understand memory locality and
cannot allocate memory in the 'closest' memory. This will lead to
performance and scalability issues.

So, don't do this:

.. code-blocK:: shell

  A=0.

Do this:

.. code-block:: shell

 !$OMP PARALLEL DO SHARED(A)
    for j=1,n
    for i=1,m
     A(i,j)=0.
   enddo
  enddo


This is not a Jet issue, but affects all architectures. By structuring
your code in the fashion above then your code will be more portable.

.. rubric:: Using MPI calls from OpenMP critical sections

When using MPI and OpenMP, it is not necessary to worry about how
threading is managed in MPI unless the MPI calls are from within
OpenMP sections. You must disable processor affinity for this to work.
To do this, you must pass the variable MV2_ENABLE_AFFINITY=0 to your
application at run time. For example:

.. code-block:: shell

 mpiexec -v MV2_ENABLE_AFFINITY=0 ......
