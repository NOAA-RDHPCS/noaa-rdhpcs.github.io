NOAA RDHPCS Systems
###################

The NOAA Research and Development High Performance Computing Systems
(RDHPCS) are a set of high performance computing systems that support
NOAA's research and development activities. These systems are used for
a wide range of applications, including weather forecasting, earth-system
modeling, and data analysis.

The RDHPCS systems are managed by the NOAA Office of the `Chief Information
Officer <https://www.noaa.gov/information-technology>`__ (OCIO)
`High-Performance Computing and Communications
<https://www.noaa.gov/information-technology/hpcc>`__ (HPCC) program, and are
located at various sites across the United States. The systems are designed to
provide high-performance computing capabilities to NOAA researchers and
developers, enabling them to conduct complex simulations and analyses that are
critical to NOAA's mission.

The current systems are listed below, with links to their user guides.

Access to these systems is managed through the RDHPCS :ref:`accounts and
projects <project_request>` process.

The RDHPCS has a collaboration with `Mississippi State University
<https://www.msstate.edu/>`__ (MSU) through the `MSU High-Performance Computing
Collaboratory <https://www.hpc.msstate.edu/>`__ (HPC\ :sup:`2`).

NOAA HPC portfolio managers (PfM) and project principal investigators (PI)
should follow the  :ref:`requesting-access-to-msu-hpc-systems` to request
project user accounts on the MSU HPC\ :sup:`2` systems.

.. rubric:: Maintenance and Events Calendar

The RDHPCS-sponsored events, which include system maintenance and downtimes are
available in the `RDHPCS Calendar
<https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=noaa.gov_f1ggu43tm9lfeeg45t59a063cs@group.calendar.google.com>`__
We suggest users add this to their own Google calendar to keep up to date with
important events.
