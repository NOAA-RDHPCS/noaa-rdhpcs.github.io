Introduction
============

NOAA has provided Mississippi State University (MSU) with Grants to
install and manage High Performance Computing (HPC) Systems to further
NOAA’s scientific research and collaboration. Through this close
partnership NOAA hopes to advance its research goals in the areas of
Severe Weather and Climate research. The exchange of technical
information between NOAA and MSU should be of great value and be
beneficial to both HPC programs.

The MSU-HPC system consists of two components, Orion and Hercules.
Orion and Hercules share a InfiniBand interconnect and two Lustre file
systems, ``/work`` and ``/work2/``.

Orion System Features:

* Total of 72,000 cores of 2.4GHz Xeon Gold CPU
* Capability of 5,000 trillion floating point operations per second –
  or 5.0 petaflops
* Nearly 350 terabytes of Random Access Memory (RAM)

Hercules System Features:

* Total of 40,960 cores of 2.3GHz Xeon Platinum CPU
* Capability of 3,000 trillion floating point operations per second –
  or 3.0 petaflops
* Nearly 256 terabytes of Random Access Memory (RAM)

Shared Between the Two HPC Systems:

* Total scratch disk capacity of 9 Petabytes on the "work" file system
* Total scratch disk capacity of 18 Petabytes on the "work2" file
  system

General Information
===================

.. _MSUHPC-logging-in:

Logging In
----------

To login to Orion or Hercules via SSH, you will use your MSU account
username, MSU password, and Duo two-factor authentication.

**Password Maintenance**

If you know your MSU password (or temporary password), use the MSU
`Training and Password System (TAPS) <TAPS_>`_ site to manage your
Multi-Factor Authentication settings with Duo, or to change your
password. The TAPS_ system is also where you go to take the MSU
training required before you can login, and for the yearly password
resets and training to keep your account active.

.. _TAPS: https://taps.hpc.msstate.edu

**Password Resets**

A password reset can only be done by phone during normal business days
(M-F) from 08:00-12:00 and 13:00-17:00 Central Time. If you forget
your password, please call: *(662) 325-9146*. If you do not get an
answer keep calling every 30 minutes. If busy, call again every 15
minutes. The MSU HPC2 admin will verify your ID, unlock your account,
and issue a temporary password that is only valid to access the TAPS_
portal.

.. note::

   The user is then required to access TAPS_ and change the temporary
   password **within 3 days**. The user must also complete any
   out-of-date training requirements.

**Setting Up DUO on a New Device**

.. note::

   This section assumes that:

   - You have already successfully configured DUO on an old device.
     (If not, please review information on Getting an Account.)
   - You have access to the old device.


#.  Go to TAPS_ and choose Manage DUO and select  **Password --> Add
    new Device**.
#.  Select **Send Me a Push**.
#.  Open DUO on the old device -- you should be prompted to accept a
    request for authentication.
#.  Approve that request and then on your PC, you should be prompted
    to enter a device type. Keep following the prompts to add a token
    to your new device.

**Login nodes: Available externally via SSH**

To SSH to Orion or Hercules, you'll need your MSU username, password
and DUO authentication:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ ssh <MSU username>@orion-login.hpc.msstate.edu


.. code-block:: shell

   $ ssh <MSU username>@hercules#login.hpc.msstate.edu

.. note::

   Orion and Hercules have multiple front-end (i.e. login) nodes.  The
   host names for these are:


   * ``orion-login-1.hpc.msstate.edu``
   * ``orion-login-2.hpc.msstate.edu``
   * ``orion-login-3.hpc.msstate.edu``
   * ``orion-login-4.hpc.msstate.edu``
   * ``hercules-login-1.hpc.msstate.edu``
   * ``hercules-login-2.hpc.msstate.edu``
   * ``hercules-login-3.hpc.msstate.edu``
   * ``hercules-login-4.hpc.msstate.edu``

   The host names ``orion-login.hpc.msstate.edu`` and
   ``hercules-login.hpc.msstate.edu`` are DNS round-robin names for
   ``orion-login-{1..4}`` and ``hercules-login-{1..4}`` respectively.

can be used to transfer data to and from Orion and Hercules
respectively.  This can be accomplished using the Globus File Manager
App or the Globus CLI.

**Development nodes: Available via SSH (internal access only)**

While compiles may be done on any of the nodes, the development nodes
serve the purpose for software development and compiles in which
additional system libraries may be requested to be installed that are
normally not required for runtime. Also, the development nodes provide
the only gateway for writing into the ``/apps/contrib/`` directories.

The development nodes for Orion are:

   * ``orion-devel-1.hpc.msstate.edu``
   * ``orion-devel-2.hpc.msstate.edu``

and for Hercules:

   * ``hercules-devel-1.hpc.msstate.edu``

Running Jobs on MSU-HPC Systems
===============================

**Running and Monitoring Jobs on Orion and Hercules**

system for execution on system compute resources. This section
All compute and memory-intensive tasks must be submitted to the batch
describes the requirements and common patterns for job submission and
monitoring.

**To improve your job turnaround** and efficiently use the system
resources, please read and follow instructions carefully.

Submitting a Job
----------------

There are two types of jobs: batch jobs and interactive jobs.

**Batch Jobs**

Most jobs are batch jobs. These jobs do not require any interaction
and consist of a shell script that contains the commands you want to
run. The ``sbatch`` command is used to submit batch jobs

.. code-block:: shell

   $ sbatch <options> <script>

Typical options are:

   - The account to charge the run to (**this is mandatory**)
   - The number of nodes/tasks needed for the job
   - The time limit for the job
   - The location of stdout/stderr
   - A job name

Slurm provides command line options in both long form and short form,
and either form can be used. For example, to specify a time limit of
30 min, all of these following forms are valid:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ sbatch -t 30          jobfile
   $ sbatch --time=30      jobfile
   $ sbatch --time=0:30:00 jobfile

In addition to the commands that you want to run, job files typically
have Slurm directives at the top job files. The directives are of the
form

.. code-block:: shell

   #SBATCH <options>
   #SBATCH <options>

For example, to specify the time limit as a directive, you should add
the ``--time=<time>`` option:

.. code-block:: shell

   #SBATCH --time=0:30:00

These directives can be used instead of specifying options on the
command line. If an option is specified both as a directive and on the
command line, the command line option takes precedence.

It is also possible to specify some of the options by setting an
environment variable. Please see the sbatch man page for details. If
the same option is specified in multiple forms, the order of
precedence is command-line, environment variable setting, and finally
the directive in the job file.

.. note::

   Refer to ``man sbatch`` or the Slurm documentation for more
   information and all available options.

**Submitting a Batch Script**

The following script is a very basic template that provides examples
for some common sbatch options. It also includes required options.
This can be used as a general guide when constructing a new batch
script:

.. code-block:: shell

   #!/bin/bash -l
   #
   # -- Request that this job run on orion
   #SBATCH --partition=orion
   #
   # -- Request 40 cores
   #SBATCH --ntasks=40
   #
   # -- Specify a maximum wallclock of 4 hours
   #SBATCH --time=4:00:00
   #
   # -- Specify under which account a job should run
   #SBATCH --account=hpl
   #
   # -- Set the name of the job, or Slurm will default to the name of the script
   #SBATCH --job-name=HPL
   #
   # -- Tell the batch system to set the working directory to the current working directory
   #SBATCH --chdir=.

   nt=$SLURM_NTASKS

   module load intel <version>
   module load impi <version>

   srun -n $nt ./xhpl

.. note::

   The variable ``$SLURM_NTASKS`` is used in the example above so that
   the rest of the script can stay portable.  If you want to change
   the number of cores used, you only change the submission, not how
   that value is used in the rest of the script.

To submit the above script, called ``jobscript.sh``, you would type:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ sbatch jobscript.sh

**Submitting a serial job**

A serial job can be run on a single node. These jobs are scheduled
separately so that the scheduler can pack multiple jobs onto a single
node, improving the overall usefulness of the system. You do not have
to specify a specific queue name. Requesting a single processor will
automatically allow sharing of the compute node.

By default, a serial job gets only its share of the memory available
on a node (memory per core = ~total memory / total cores). If your
serial job needs more memory than the default, specify that using the
``--mem=<mem>`` option.

**Submitting an Interactive Job**

An interactive job is useful for tasks, such as debugging, that
require interactive access with a program as it runs. With Slurm there
are two ways to run jobs interactively, ``srun`` or ``salloc``. We
recommend that you use ``salloc``.

For example, to request two nodes for 30 min (with X11 forwarding so
that you can use X-windows based tools) you can do the following:

.. code-block:: shell

   salloc --x11=first -q debug -t 0:30:00 --nodes=2 -A marine-cpu

When you run the ``salloc`` command, you won't get a prompt back until
the batch system scheduler is able to run the job. Once that happens,
the scheduler will drop you into a login session on the head node
allocated to your interactive job. At this point, you will have a
prompt and may run commands, such as your codes or debuggers as
desired. In the example above, an ``srun`` command is executed.
``salloc`` is similar to sbatch in that it creates an allocation for
you to run in, however only interactive jobs can be run inside the
salloc allocation.

If you need to display X windows back to your desktop screen from
within an interactive job, you must use ``ssh -X`` when logging in.

**Submitting a job with arguments**

If you want to submit a script that accepts arguments you need to add
the arguments after the job file name on the sbatch command. It is
similar to the Unix method of passing arguments to a script as shown
in the example below:

.. code-block:: shell

   sbatch batch.job arg1 arg2

The command above passes ``arg1`` as ``$1`` and ``arg2`` as ``$2``
etc., similar to the Unix convention of argument passing.

**Submitting jobs with job dependencies**

Slurm supports the ability to submit a job with dependencies with
other jobs. A simple example is where job Y cannot execute until job X
completes. The use of the ``-d <options>``
(``--dependency=<options>``) is the way to specify the job dependency.

Review the ``man sbatch`` for a list of dependency conditions (look
for ``--dependency`` in the options list) that can be used. Usage
format is illustrated in the example script below that includes
``afterok`` as a dependency condition.

Here is a simple example of how to run a chain of jobs with
dependencies, assuming that you have a parallel ``helloworld.f``
example program in your current directory.

- Create/edit the file "**depend**" with the content:

.. code-block:: shell

   #!/bin/bash
   jid1=$(sbatch --parsable -n1 -A noaatest -J sim --wrap="srun sleep 10")
   jid2=$(sbatch --parsable -n1 -A noaatest -J post --dependency=afterok:$jid1 --wrap="srun hostname")

.. note::

   The ``--parsable`` option returns just the Job ID from sbatch.

- Make it executable:

.. code-block:: shell

   $
   chmod 0755 depend

- Initiate the sequence of dependent jobs by executing ``depend`` from
  the command line.


.. code-block:: shell

   $ ./depend

**Big runs:  Using the "novel" QoS**

The *novel* QoS is set up to handle special situations, particularly
for large jobs requiring a large number of nodes (typically for
limited time):

A couple of examples are given below:

-  Users may have an occasional need to run very big jobs that would
   normally not fit within the limits of the *batch* QoS.
-  Users may have a need to do some scalability studies that may
   require running up to a very large node count.

It would be very disruptive to schedule such big jobs during normal
production time. So jobs in the novel QOS would typically be run at
the end of maintenance downtimes.

If you have such needs please submit a help desk ticket with the
subject line "Request for running jobs in novel QoS" and provide the
following information:

-  How many jobs will you be submitting?
-  What is the number of nodes your biggest job would need?
-  What is the maximum length of estimated time your jobs would need
   to be completed?
-  If there are multiple jobs can they all be run at the same time?
-  Can other jobs be run at the same time as your jobs or do you need
   exclusive user of the nodes?
-  Do you need to be able to monitor your runs when your jobs are
   running? As mentioned above, jobs in the novel QoS will normally be
   run during downtimes and users typically don't have access to the
   machine to do the monitoring.

Best effort will be made to schedule those runs at the end of
maintenance downtimes that typically happen once a month.

**Job Submission Options**

The options you are allowed to specify are the set of options used for
the Slurm batch system.  For a list of options refer to ``man
sbatch``, run ``sbatch --help``, or refer to the Slurm documentation.

**Command-line options vs directive options**

There are two way to specify sbatch options. The first is on the
command line when issuing the sbatch command. For example:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ sbatch -A fim --ntasks=256 jobscript.sh

The second method is to insert directives at the top of the batch
script using #SBATCH syntax. For example:

.. code-block:: shell

   #!/bin/bash -l

   #SBATCH -A fim
   #SBATCH --ntasks=256

The two methods may be mixed together, if desired. Options specified
on the command line always override options specified in the script.

**Specifying the project account**

Use the ``-A`` (``--account``) option to specify the project that will
be charged when your job is run.

.. note::

   You are required to specify an account when a job is submitted

.. code-block:: shell

   $ sbatch -A fim

+---------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+

To specify a partition for your job, use the ``-p`` (``--partition``)
option.  For example:

.. code-block:: shell

   #SBATCH --partition=service

to request the *service* partition.

**Specifying Wall Clock Time**

You should specify a wall clock time for your job.  The default
wall-clock time is 5 minutes if not defined.  If your jobs will take
longer than 5 minutes, request a wall clock time reasonably close to
but not less than (see note below) the actual wall clock time that the
job will take to run.  Specifying an excessively large wall clock time
will result in increased wait time for your job to start and, more
importantly, reduced scheduler efficiency and overall system
utilization.  When requesting multiple partitions (see below), as is
recommended, take into account the longest run time partition.  Due to
several other factors that effect run time, your job run time on a
slower partition may be better as compared to the billable TRes per
core performance factor listed in the partition tables above.
Therefore:

Frequently review the wall clock time of the jobs you run in order to
better estimate your requested wall clock time. Increased accuracy of
specified wall clock time with your job submissions will shorten queue
wait times, and increase scheduler efficiency and overall system
utilization.

.. note::

   We recommend that you do NOT set a wall clock time less than 5
   minutes.

.. note::

   Any job that runs longer than its requested wall clock time or the
   partition's time limit will be terminated by the scheduler. When
   specifying your wall clock time, add some extra time to your recent
   observed run time history to be sure it will finish to allow for
   random fluctuations in run times caused by system load.  For
   example, 10-20% for short run times, 5-10% for long run times.

For example, to set a one-hour time limit:

.. code-block:: shell

   #SBATCH --time=1:00:00

**Specifying a Quality of Service (QOS)**

To specify a quality-of-service (QOS), use the ``--qos`` (``-q``)
option. For example

.. code-block:: shell

   #SBATCH -q batch

There are several different QOS'es depending on your needs.

.. note::

   If you have an windfall only allocation (allocation = 1) you can
   only submit to the *windfall* QOS.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :align: left

   * - QOS
     - Minimum Nodes
     - Maximum Nodes
     - Maximum Wall Clock
     - Billing TRES Factor
     - Description and Limits
   * - All QOS's
     -
     -
     -
     -
     - Max of 400 pending/running jobs per project/account, additional
       jobs will be rejected. Max of 20 jobs per project/account will
       gain age priority. Exceptions are stated below.
   * - batch
     - 1
     - 500
     - 8 hours
     - 1.0
     -  Default QOS for non-reservation jobs with an allocation more
        then *Windfall-Only* (``RawShare=1``).
   * - urgent
     - 1
     - 500 (Orion), 250 (Hercules)
     - 8 hours
     - 2.0
     -  QOS for a job that requires more urgency than *batch*. Your
        project :ref:`FairShare <slurm-fairshare>` will be lowered at
        2.0x the rate as compared to *batch*.  Only one job pe
        project/account can be pending/runnin at any time. When a
        project's FairShare is below 0.45, jobs submmit to *urgent*
        are automatically changed to *batch* and users notified via
        stderr.
   * - debug
     - 1
     - 500 (Orion), 250 (Hercules)
     - 30 minutes
     - 1.25
     - Highest priority QOS, useful for debugging sessions.  Your
       project :ref:`FairShare <slurm-fairshare>` will be lowered at
       1.25x the rate as compared to *batch*.  Only two jobs per user
       can be pending/running at any time.  This QOS should NOT be
       used for fast-turnaround of general work. While the *debug* QOS
       is available, we recommend that if you need to work through an
       iterative process to debug a code, that you submit a longer
       running interactive job to the default QOS so that you can
       restart your application over and over again without having to
       start a new batch job.
   * - windfall
     - 1
     - 500 (Orion), 250 (Hercules)
     - 8 hours (Partition exception: *service*)
     - 0.0
     - Lowest priority QOS.  If you have an allocation of
       windfall-only (monthly allocation is 1) you can only submit to
       this QOS.  Submitting to this QOS will NOT affect your future
       job priority :ref:`FairShare <slurm-fairshare>` factor (f) for
       your non-windfall jobs. Useful for low priority jobs that will
       only run when the system/partition has enough unused space
       available while not effecting the project's FairShare priority.
   * - novel
     - 501 (Orion), 251 (Hercules)
     - Largest partition size
     - 8 hours
     - 1.0
     - QOS for running novel or experimental where nearly the full
       system is required.  If you need to use the *novel* QOS, please
       submit a ticket to the :ref:`help system <getting_help>` and
       tell us what you want to do.  We will normally have to arrange
       for some time for the job to go through, and we would like to
       plan the process with you.

**Specifying a job name**

Giving your jobs meaningful names can help you locate them when
monitoring their progress. Use the ``-J`` (``--job-name``) option. For
example:

.. code-block:: shell

   #SBATCH -J WRF_ARW_00Z

The default name for a job is the name of the job script that is being
submitted.

**Setting the names of output files**

If you do not specify the names of the output files that contain the
stdout and stderr from your job script, a file will be written to the
directory in which you issued the sbatch command. A file containing
both the stdout and stderr from your job script will be called:
``slurm-<jobid>.out`` where ``<jobid>`` is the Slurm job ID.

Use the ``-o`` (``--output``) option to specify the name of the stdout
file

.. code-block:: shell

   #SBATCH -o /full/path/of/stdout/file

Use the ``-e`` (``--error``) option to specify the name of the stderr
file

.. code-block:: shell

   #SBATCH -e /full/path/of/stderr/file

If you want stdout and stderr to go to the same file, do not specify
the ``-e`` option.

**Passing environment variables to the job**

By default the environment variables set in the current shell is
passed to the job that is submitted.  However if any variable is
explicitly passed into the script with a value, only that value is
passed to the script!

If you wish to pass local environment to the script and in addition
set a specific variable that is currently not in the current
environment (``ndays=20`` in the example below), you can do it in the
following way

.. code-block:: shell

   sbatch --export=ALL,ndays=20 … sbatch.job


It is important to note that ``ALL`` is required if you want the local
environment variables are to be exported to the script in addition to
the value explicitly set. If ``ALL`` is left out, only the value of
``ndays=20`` is passed in.

If you do not want to export your local environment, use the following
syntax:

.. code-block:: shell

   sbatch --export=NONE … sbatch.job

.. caution::

   Not exporting the current environment can be a little tricky and
   likely to cause some errors unless the necessary environment is
   created in the job. It may also require setting ``--export=ALL`` on
   the ``srun`` command within the job.

**Requesting email notification about jobs**

You can use the ``--mail-user`` and ``--mail-type`` options to request
notifications by email when a job enters one or more states.  Both
options are required.  Use the ``--mail-user`` option to specify a
comma delimited list of email addresses where email notifications are
to be sent.  Use the ``--mail-type`` option to specify which job
states you want email notifications for. The most useful notifications
flags passed to ``--mail-type`` are *NONE*, *BEGIN(, *END*, and *FAIL*
and can be combined. A full list of parameters can be found on the
sbatch man page.

-  FAIL: mail is sent when the job fails with non-zero exit code.
-  BEGIN: mail is sent when the job begins execution.
-  END: mail is sent when the job terminates.
-  NONE: no email is sent.

To send email notification to Joe and Jane when your job starts and
when it terminates,

.. code-block:: shell

   $ sbatch --mail-user=Joe.User@noaa.gov,Jane.User@noaa.gov \
      --mail-type=<the other options go here> myscript.sh

**Specifying the working directory as the current directory**

It is good practice to keep your batch scripts portable, and when they
get moved around the working directory is relative to where the script
is. To do this, specify the working directory with the ``-D``
(``--chdir``) option as the current directory.

.. code-block:: shell

   #SBATCH -D .

The other way to do this is with the ``$SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR`` variable.
This variable stores the path from where your script was submitted. So
at the top of your batch script, add

.. code-block:: shell

   cd $SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR

**Starting a job after a specific date/time**

If a job is waiting for data to arrive based on time of day (e.g.,
12:30Z), the ``--begin`` option allows for a job to hold in the queue
until at least the time (or date/time) specified with the option. For
example:

.. code-block:: shell

   #SBATCH --begin=19:25

The above option will cause the job to hold until 19:25 GMT. If
resources are available shortly after 19:25, the job will run. If not,
the job will wait until resources are available (this is not a
reservation). Note that if the sbatch was submitted at 19:26 GMT, the
job will hold until 19:25 GMT the next day!

Date/time can be specified:

.. code-block:: shell

   YYYY-MM-DD[Thh:mm[:ss]]

*YYYY* is year, *MM* is month, *DD* is day, *hh* is hour, *mm* is
minute and *ss* is second. The letter "T" is required as a delimiter
if specifying both date and time. All times are considered to be in
the future, so

.. code-block:: shell

   2110-12-21T06:30

would be December 21, 2110 at 06:30 GMT.

The ``--begin`` option also accepts an arbitrary amount of time to
wait. For example:

.. code-block:: shell

   #SBATCH --begin=now+1hour

will start the job 1 hour from when the job is launched, if resources
are available.

Monitoring Jobs
---------------

**List jobs**

Use the ``squeue`` command to get a listing of the current jobs in the
queue

.. code-block:: shell

   $ squeue
    JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
    30049     orion     test Kyle.Ste  R       0:02      1 t758

**List jobs that belong only to you**

Use the ``-u`` option to list only the jobs that belong to you.
Provide your username as an argument to ``-u``. This is preferable to
using ``squeue \| grep`` to extract the jobs that belong to you for
two reasons. First, this method allows you to see which of the jobs
are active, eligible, and blocked. Second, usernames are truncated in
the ``squeue`` output, making it hard to grep

.. code-block:: shell

   $ squeue -u <user name>

**List jobs that have completed within the last 24 hours**

Use the ``sacct`` command option to list jobs that have run within the
last 24 hours and to see their statuses (State). A full list of
``sacct`` options and job states can be found on the ``sacct`` man
page.

.. code-block:: shell

   % sacct --user $USER \
           --starttime `date --date="yesterday" +%F` \
           -X \
           --format=JobID,JobName%30,Partition,Account,AllocCPUS,State,Elapsed,QOS

**Query detailed job status information for a specific job**

Use the ``scontrol show job`` command to query detailed information
about queued or running jobs or jobs that have finished in the last 15
minutes. This could be useful when trying to determine why a job is
not running and has remained queued for a long time:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ scontrol show job 251091

**Query a job's estimated start time**


Use the ``squeue --start`` command to get a point-in-time estimate of
when your job may start. Reservation based start time estimation
incorporates information regarding current administrative, user, and
job reservations to determine the earliest time the specified job
could allocate the needed resources and start running. In essence,
this estimate will indicate the earliest time the job would start
assuming this job was the highest priority job in the queue:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ squeue --start
    JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST          START_TIME  NODES SCHEDNODES           NODELIST(REASON)
   251092     orion     test Kyle.Ste PD 2019-03-29T18:55:58     17 (null)   (BeginTime)

.. note::

   The start time estimate can change drastically, depending on the
   number of partitions specified, new jobs being submitted to the
   queue, and how accurately idle jobs and running jobs have specified
   their wall clock time.

**Deleting jobs**

To cancel a job use the scancel command:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ scancel $JOBID

Getting Information about your Projects
---------------------------------------

MSU-HPC uses Slurm as its batch scheduler, as does NOAA's RDHPCS
systems. Slurm allocations result in a percentage of total system
priority.

**Load contrib and noaatools Module**

The module tools work on all MSU-HPC systems. On the MSU-HPC side,
load the noaatools modu:: shell

   $ module avail
   $ module load contrib noaatools
   $ module list

**saccount_params**

Use ``saccount_params`` to get information on your projects and disk
usage, and quota:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ saccount_params
   Account Params -- Information regarding project associations for userid
       Home Quota (/home/userid) Used: 1035 MB Quota: 8192 MB Grace: 10240

       Project: noaa-hpc
           ProjectFairshare=N/A    Core Hours Used=N/A

           Directory: /work/noaa/noaatest DiskInUse=0 GB, Quota=0 GB, Files=0, FileQUota=0

       Project: noaatest
           ProjectFairshare=0.040 (356/414)    Core Hours Used (30 days)=96.6, 30-day Allocation=2
           Partition Access: ALL
           Available QOSes: batch,debug,novel,ood,special,urgent,windfall

           Directory: /work/noaa/noaatest DiskInUse=83981 GB, Quota=95000 GB, Files=3633923, FileQUota=0

       Project: role-noaatest
           ProjectFairshare=N/A    Core Hours Used=N/A

.. note::

   For an explanation of the meaning of these values and general
   scheduling information review Slurm documentation.

.. note::

   The parenthetical values after project fairshare indicate the rank
   of the project with respect to all other allocated projects. If the
   first number is lower, your project is likely to have higher
   priority than other projects. (Of course, other factors weigh in to
   scheduling.)

.. note::

   Your must use the ``saccount_params`` command.  There is no
   ``account_params`` command alias.

**shpcrpt**

Use ``shpcrpt`` to get project usage information.

To get a summary of all project on orion:

.. code-block:: shell

   $  shpcrpt -c orion -s

Account Management
==================

Overview
--------

MSU user accounts are completely independent of NOAA RDHPCS Accounts.
The MSU’s HPC2 Account Management System and Process is used to create
and manage users' accounts for all NOAA work performed on the MSU-HPC
system.

.. note::

   MSU's Account Management system requires user authentication.
   Account Managers and Portfolio Managers must maintain an active MSU
   account to manage their projects online. If an Account Manager or
   Portfolio Manager has an issue with their MSU account access, they
   should enter an MSU-HPC Help Request.

MSU Account Management Policies
-------------------------------

- New user accounts are requested by a supervisor/sponsor using the
  `MSU HPC2 Account Management website
  <https://intranet.hpc.msstate.edu/services/external_accounts/noaa/>`_.
  Only current Account Managers may be a supervisor/sponsor. The same
  website is used for project assignments. Users can only submit jobs
  to those Projects to which they have access.
- All user accounts have an expiration date set by the
  supervisor/sponsor when the user account is requested. The maximum
  expiration date is 12 months from the initiation date. When a user
  account approaches its expiration date, the supervisor/sponsor is
  notified via email, and may extend the user account for up to one
  year, using the `MSU online account management tools
  <https://intranet.hpc.msstate.edu/services/external_accounts/noaa/>`__
- Training updates are required each January 1. Users have until the
  end of January to comply, using the online MSU HPC2 `Training and
  Password System <TAPS_>`_, otherwise the user account is locked.
- MSU uses Duo (Cisco) two factor authentication. You may install the
  application on your smartphone or request a physical token. If
  approved, the token will be shipped to the address provided during
  the Account Management on-boarding process.
- After seven (7) unsuccessful login attempts, user login attempts
  will be denied for ten (10) minutes.
- After 90 days of inactivity (no successful login to MSU-HPC or
  authentication to one of the MSU Account Management web pages) a
  user account is locked. To unlock the account please see: Password
  Resets
- If a locked (inactive) account is not renewed, when it passes its
  expiration date the locked account is marked for deletion (TBD). The
  account may be deleted after a 1 month grace period. After deletion
  the user must start over as a new user to regain an MSU account.


Managing Project and Role Account Members
-----------------------------------------

MSU users have their accounts created and are added and removed from
both projects and Role accounts, by the Account Manager or Portfolio
Manager of the project. Go to Getting an Account for details. PfMs and
AMs use the MSU Account Management Pages to add or remove an existing
user from a project or a Role Account.

NOAA Portfolio, Project, and User Management on MSU-HPC
-------------------------------------------------------

NOAA's Research and Development HPC (RDHPCS) efforts are organized
into Portfolios. Portfolio allocations on each system are assigned by
the NOAA RDHPCS Allocation Committee and are managed by a Portfolio
Manager (PfM). Portfolios in turn are sub-organized into Projects
(Accounts or Groups). At MSU a project is managed by its Account
Managers (similar to PI's on NOAA RDHPCS systems) who are the
Portfolio Manager and other Account Managers as requested by the
Portfolio Manager and approved by the NOAA resource management.

Portfolio Managers (PfMs) are responsible for the projects and Account
Managers in their portfolio, including CPU allocations and scratch
disk quotas. PfMs request active users to be Account Managers via a
help ticket: MSU-HPC Help Request. Account Managers are responsible to
add, remove, and control project members usage and behavior, provide
guidance on resource utilization, and monitor CPU and storage usage
for their projects. At MSU Account Managers also request new user
accounts and request renewal of current user accounts when it
approaches its expiration date as the user's supervisor/sponsor.

To access the MSU-HPC resources, an existing active user must be a
member of at least one project. An Account Managers assigns an
existing user to one or more of their projects, using MSU's Account
Management Tool. To add new users, an Account Manager makes a new user
request using MSU's Account Management Tool. The requestor becomes the
new user's sponsor/supervisor.

To create a new MSU-HPC project within a Portfolio, the Portfolio
Manager must provide the following information in a help ticket:

- Project name
- Project acronym
- Project description
- Core-hour CPU allocation. Re-distribute CPU allocation across their
  projects to give the new project a CPU allocation
- Request a scratch disk quota, if needed
- Optionally, Designate another Account Manager(s)
- Designate at least one member who is an active MSU-HPC user

To close a MSU-HPC project, the Portfolio Manager must provide the
following information in a help ticket: MSU-HPC Help Request.

- Project to be closed
- Re-distribute core-hour CPU allocation across their remaining
  projects
- Data disposition information for any remaining scratch data

.. note::

   If you need an account on MSU-HPC, contact your project's Account
   Manager to submit an account request for you.

Getting An Account
------------------

MSU-HPC users are not allowed to request their own account on the
system. A new account request must come from a project's Account
Manager (like a RDHPCS Principal Investigator - PI) or a project's
Portfolio Manager (PfM) who holds an MSU account.

**Submit a New User Account Request (Account Manager/PI/PfM Responsibility)**

The following procedure is intended for the Account Manager or the
Portfolio Manager who has an active MSU account.

**Assemble User Information**

Before you begin, collect the following details:

-  First Name
-  Last Name
-  Desired Login Name - Typcially first initial, last name
   (John Doe = jdoe)
-  Email address. Preferably the user's @noaa.gov address. Otherwise
   use a business email address that best aligns with the user's work
   or university.
-  Effective Date. Typically today
-  Expiration Date. 1 year or less from the Effective Date.
-  Project(s) As Account Manager, you can only assign a user to your
   projects.

.. Note::

   When you request a new account, you become the account supervisor.
   As supervisor, you are responsible to renew the user's account when
   it approaches the expiration date.

**Login to the MSU account management system**

-  Navigate to the `MSU Account Management website
   <https://intranet.hpc.msstate.edu/services/external_accounts/noaa/>`_

**Check to see if the user already has an account. If not, request account.**

-  NOAA-HPC Project Management by User
-  If the user appears in the drop-down, their MSU account already
   exists. Select the user and assign them to your projects. If not,
   navigate to: NOAA-HPC Computer Account Request
-  Complete the form.
-  Click save and Submit. This completes the initial account request.
   It's good practice to notify the prospective new user that the
   request has been made, so they can expect email from MSU.

Once the initial account request has been submitted, MSU will send the
prospective user email similar to the following, to request the
additional information needed for the background check and account
finalizatize:

.. code-block:: shell

   From: help@hpc.msstate.edu
   Date: Fri, Jan 31, 2020 at 12:21 PM
   Subject: NOAA-HPC Users Agreement confirmation
   To: <john.doe@noaa.gov>

   A computer account request has been submitted to the the Mississippi State
   University High Performance Computing Collaboratory (MSU HPC2) on your
   behalf.  In order to facilitate continued processing of this account request,
   you must complete the application via the below web address.

   `<https://www.hpc.msstate.edu/computing/external_accounts/noaa/confirmAccount.php>`__

   This request will be removed from the queue if no response is received by
   02/14/20.

   For problems related to your computer account request, please reply to this
   message and provide details of the problem.

   If you received this email in error, you can simply ignore the email.

-  Click on the link provided in the email, fill out the form, agree
   to the terms and conditions, and submit the form.

.. note::

   If you have an NOAA RDHPCS account, use the same Organization,
   Phone, and Address you use in AIM. Otherwise, use your business
   contact information.

If you find you are unable to submit the form, try another password.
**Do not use the # character** as it has periodically caused problems.
Certain other characters in the password might block the form
submission, please submit a help ticket if you experience a problem.

.. note::

   The password that you enter will be your temporary password. So
   **please remember your password.**  This is critical to the next
   step of the on-boarding process.

**Set Password and Complete Training (User)**

MSU vets the account request and creates the user account (1-2 weeks).
MSU then sends email, similar to the one below, will be to the new
prospective user. To find the email, search your emails with the
following:

.. code-block:: shell

   From: @hpc.msstate.edu
   Subject: new user account

   The following account has been created:

   ReqDate     EffDate     Supervisor  MSU_Status  Account_Type   Login   UserName

   2020-01-31  2020-01-29  name        NonMSU      Orion          jdoe    John Doe


   Two-Factor authentication (2FA) registration and password changing is
   required within 3 days. Security training must then be completed before HPC2
   resources can be accessed.

   Visit TAPS to complete these requirements.


**Login to MSU's Training and Password System**

- Within 3 days of receiving the email, navigate to TAPS_.
- Authenticate using your username and your temporary password.
-  Upon successful login, you will see the TAPS_ Home page.

.. note::

   If your temporary 3-day password has expired, it will need to be
   reset.

-  Click on the IT Security *Start training* button.
-  Upon successful completion of the training, you will get a
   confirmation.
-  Go back to the TAPS_ Home page.

**Take MSU Insider Threat Training**

-  Click on the Insider Threat *Start training* button. Upon
   successful completion of the training, you will get a confirmation.
-  Go back to the TAPS_ Home page.

**Dual-factor authentication and Password Change (User)**

-  Navigate to TAPS_

**Setup Dual-factor authentication App**

- Click on the *Manage Duo and Password* button.
- Specify Duo Mobile Phone Device
- Specify Duo Mobile Phone Number
- Specify Duo Phone Type*
- Install Duo App
- Activate Duo App
- Change Temporary Password
- Password Change Successful
- Logout and log back in again

Congratulations! Your account is now fully set up and you can login to
MSU-HPC.

**Account Reactivation**

If your account has expired, you will need to reactivate. To begin the
process, start a Help ticket.


Account Renewal
---------------

To keep your MSU account current and active:

-  Log on to the system every 90 days (successful login to MSU-HPC or
   authentication to one of the MSU Account Management web pages).
-  Complete yearly password changes and security training updates,
   which are required each January (regardless of your effective
   date). Users have until the end of January to comply, using the
   online MSU HPC2 Training and Password System TAPS_, otherwise the
   user account will be locked.
-  Make sure your supervisor renews your account before the account
   expiration date.

If an MSU account is not renewed by the expiration date, the account
will be locked. The expiration date is set by the account supervisor
when the user account is created or renewed, and cannot be more than
one (1) year from the effective date. The user account renewal request
can only be completed by the supervisor of record. If the supervisor
is to be on an extend absence, then the supervisor should start an
Orion help ticket to assign a new supervisor so the user may maintain
their account during your absence.

.. note::

   A users Home File System directory (``/home/userID``) is deleted
   when a user's account is deleted.  User account deletion can occur
   any time after a user account is scheduled for deletion. User
   accounts are scheduled for deletion 2 weeks after a user accounts
   expiration date and the account is not renewed.  Once your HFS data
   is deleted it will NOT be recoverable. Project data (``/work``) is
   not deleted when a users account is deleted.

**Renewal Request Email from MSU (Supervisor)**

When an active user's account approaches the expiration date, an email
will be sent to the supervisor from MSU so that the supervisor can
request a renewal or decide not to renew the account.

Here is an example of the email:

.. code-block:: shell

   From: <null@hpc.msstate.edu>
   Date: Thu, Jan 21, 2021 at 8:11 AM
   Subject: HPC-NOAA Computer Account Expiration Notice
   To: <jdoe@hpc.msstate.edu>

   The external users agreement for J. Doe will expire on 02/05/21.  If
   you wish to renew this agreement, please go to:
   https://intranet.hpc.msstate.edu/services/external_accounts/noaa/requestAccount.php?id=1234&user=jdoe

   to request a renewal of the agreement.  If you do not wish to renew this
   agreement, please ignore this email.

   --
   Systems Administration Team
   High Performance Computing Collaboratory
   Mississippi State University
   help@hpc.msstate.edu

If the renewal time has passed, or the initial account renewal email
was missed, request an account renewal through the MSU intranet.

**Fill out the NOAA-HPC Computer Account Request Form**

#.  Note the Expiration Date in the email.
#.  Follow the link to open a pre-populated webform. You may be
    required to provide your MSU login credentials. If you don't know
    your password start an Orion help ticket
#. Verify the email address. Change it if needed.
#. Set the Effective Date.  The effective date may pre-populate with
   the current date instead of the Expiration Date. Change the
   Effective Date to be the Expiration Date in the email.
#. Set the new Expiration Date.  This should be set to 1 year after
   the new Effective Date (if your Effective Date is 02/05/23, the
   Expiration Date should be 02/05/24), unless you want the user
   account to expire sooner than 1 year. 1 year is the max allowed by
   MSU.
#.  Save Request when complete

This completes the renewal request. The supervisor should consider
notifying the user that the renewal request has been made so they will
be vigilant for an email from MSU. MSU will email the user to provide
additional information and confirm the request.

**HPC2-NOAA User Account Request Confirmation (User)**

Once the account renewal request has been submitted by the supervisor,
an email similar to the one below will be sent from MSU directly to
the user, asking for additional information and request confirmation:

.. code-block:: shell

   From: help@HPC.MsState.Edu <help@HPC.MsState.Edu>
   Sent: January 21, 2021 13:03
   To: forrest.hobbs@noaa.gov
   Subject: NOAA-HPC Users Agreement confirmation

   A computer account request has been submitted to the the Mississippi State
   University High Performance Computing Collaboratory (MSU HPC2) by Eric
   Schnepp on your behalf.  In order to facilitate continued processing of this
   account request, you must complete the application via the below web address.

   https://www.hpc.msstate.edu/computing/external_accounts/noaa/confirmAccount.php?confCode=XXXXXXXX

   This request will be removed from the queue if no response is received by
   02/04/21.

   For problems related to your computer account request, please reply to this
   message and provide details of the problem.

   If you received this email in error, you can simply ignore the email.

   help@hpc.msstate.edu

**Fill out the HPC2-NOAA User Account Request Confirmation Form**

#.  Click on the link provided in the email
#.  Fill out the form.

   -  Your password is your current MSU password. If you don't know
      your password start an Orion help ticket.
   -  If you have an NOAA RDHPCS account use the same Organization,
      Phone, and Address you use in AIM. Otherwise, use your business
      contact information.

#.  Agree to the terms and conditions, and submit the form.

The form will then be submitted back to MSU for final approval.  If
the renewal is approved you will not be notified, and your access is
maintained.  If the renewal is denied the supervisor will be notified
by email.

Managing Portfolios, Projects and Allocation
--------------------------------------------

**Portfolio Management on MSU-HPC Systems**

On the MSU-HPC system, Portfolios, Projects, and Project Allocations
are managed by Portfolio Managers (PfM's) and Principle Investigators
(PI's) the exact same way as they are for NOAA's RDHPCS systems
(Hera/Jet/Gaea/HPSS). The main difference for Account Management
between NOAA RDHPCS systems and the MSU-HPC system is how Project
members (users) are managed.

**Managing Projects within a Portfolio**

Project changes (add or remove a project, changing the PI, changing
compute allocation and disk quota) on MSU-HPC systems are requested by
the Portfolio Manager, who emails the :ref:`Orion Help System
<getting_help>`.

.. note::

   Projects with the same name between RDHPCS systems and MSU-HPC
   systems will have the same PI, and the MSU-HPC project must have
   the same user membership on Hercules and Orion.

.. note::

   The portfolio manager is responsible for the portfolio across all
   R&D HPC resources (MSU-HPC/Hera/Jet/HPSS/Gaea).

**Managing Allocations**

Allocations on this system are managed exactly as they are for NOAA's
RDHPCS systems (Hera, Jet etc.)

Role Accounts
-------------

Role accounts are available on the MSU-HPC system. A Role account
allows multiple members of a project to manage a project's scientific
work, including but not limited to automated workflows.

Mississippi State University's MSU-HPC system has system-specific
policies concerning Role Accounts. These are required for MSU to
remain compliant with their security controls and security plan.

 **Role Account Policies**

 -  A role account is a user account shared by one or more users.
 -  Role accounts follow the naming convention
    ``role-baseprojectname``.
 -  There can be only one role account per MSU-HPC project, and a role
    account can be only assigned to a single project.
 -  Role accounts are managed by the same Account Managers as the base
    project.
 -  A role account is managed like a project (ex. membership is
    managed by the Account Managers on the NOAA-HPC Project Management
    by Project" page). Any MSU-HPC user can be a member of the role
    account, but it is recommended that they also be a member of the
    base project.
 -  Role accounts are only created with approval of one of the base
    projects Account Managers (Portfolio Mgr or PI).
 -  No passwords or Duo will be assigned to Role accounts.
 -  Role accounts may be used for setting up unattended data transfers
    via SSH key pairs
 -  Role accounts may run jobs, utilize cron services, and be used to
    manage contrib directories.
 -  Access to the Role account shall be done via the ``sudo - su
    role-PROJECTNAME`` command.
 -  The sudo command can be run on Login, Development, and DTN nodes.

 **To Request and/or perform Management on a Role Account**

 -  The PI or PfM should submit a request by emailing the Help Desk at
    rdhpcs.orion.help@noaa.gov.
 -  The request should include:

   -  Name:
   -  PI:
   -  Project:
   -  Users:

 -  The Role account will be created and the PI will be assigned as
    the Account Manager. As with projects, the PI may request that
    additional Account Managers be assigned as well.
 -  The PI/Account Managers must use the *Project Management* web form
    to add and remove users from their Role account.


Help, Policies, Best Practices, Issues
======================================

MSU-HPC Help Requests
---------------------

If you have any issues, questions, or comments, please email the Help
System: rdhpcs.orion.help@noaa.gov

.. note::

   Help tickets are normally addressed by the RDHPCS User Support team
   and the MSU Orion Support team from 0900 -1700 Eastern Time, Monday
   - Friday, except Government holidays.


Policies and Best Practices
---------------------------

* All MSU-HPC accounts are managed outside of NOAA and are therefore
  subject to MSU's Account Management and Security Policies.
* If you have an active NOAA email account, then this must be used
  when creating a MSU account.
* Only members of NOAA projects are allowed to access NOAA's data
  directories (``/work/noaa`` and ``/work2/noaa``).
* Only users with an active NOAA account will be able to reach R&D
  HPCS documentation.
* Access to the Niagara system requires an active RDHPCS account.

.. note::

   A users Home File System directory (/home/userID) is deleted when a
   user's account is deleted. User account deletion can occur any time
   after a user account is scheduled for deletion. User accounts are
   scheduled for deletion 2 weeks after a user accounts expiration
   date and the account is not renewed. Once your HFS data is deleted
   it will NOT be recoverable. Project data (``/work`` and ``/work2``)
   is not deleted when a users account is deleted.

**Best Practices**

-  Due to limited disk space on Orion, it is highly recommended that
   data be moved back to the R&D HPC Niagara system.
-  Due to limited network bandwidth, it is highly recommended that
   Globus be used for moving data between Orion and Niagara.

Protecting Restricted Data
--------------------------

Restricted data (*rstprod*) is allowed on the MSU-HPC system. Be sure
to follow all of NOAA's restricted data policies when using MSU-HPC.
Request access to *rstprod* via AIM.  Provide the following
information in your justification:

-  The machine(s) where you will need rstprod access on (i.e.
   Hercules, Orion).
-  The project(s) you will be using rstprod data for.


MSU FAQ
=======

**What are the differences between Orion and  Hercules?**

Although the ``/work`` and ``/work2`` file systems are mounted on both
Orion and Hercules (via a shared InfiniBand interconnect), you should
expect Hercules to behave like a standalone HPC system.

Here are some of the key differences:

-  Orion runs CentOS 7.x for its Operating System. Hercules runs Rocky
   Linux 9.x for its Operating System. There may be subtle differences
   between the two.
-  Hercules has all of the same basic software packages as Orion, but
   with the latest version of each package installed. MSU will
   consider installing older software versions upon request. This
   should be done via a help ticket and should include a justification
   as to why the older version is needed and an estimate as to how
   long it will be needed.
-  With a few exceptions, Spack is being used to build and manage the
   Open-source software stack on Hercules. This includes the module
   file for each Open-source software package. The directory and
   module names are different then Orion.
-  The "/apps" directory structure is significantly different between
   the two system. Software built on Hercules, using Spack, will be
   installed in its own ``/apps/spack/<package-hash>`` subdirectory.
   Any software package built with Spack will have a Spack generated
   hash as part of it's directory name. Any time ``/apps/spack``
   software package are rebuilt they will get a new hash. This may
   occur often. So it is imperative to not use hard coded paths and
   instead, us modules for loading the required build and run
   environment.
-  The name and order by which module files are loaded is different
   between the two systems.

Here are other items of interest:

-  Hercules has its own set of Login nodes, Development nodes, Compute
   nodes, Data Transfer nodes, etc.
-  Hercules has its own Home File System (HFS) and its own
   ``/apps/contrib`` directory. As with Orion, only the HFS is the
   ONLY file system which is backed up.
-  Hercules has a completely separate CRON service. Workflows need to
   be managed independently on the two systems. Please use ``<system
   name>-login-1`` for editing your crontab file.
-  The Batch system is completely separate between the two systems. A
   project's Fairshare on one system will not impact the project's
   Fairshare on the other system. Users cannot check the status or
   submit jobs between the two systems. There is no Federated
   configuration in place.
-  Although core-hour (Fairshare) allocation will be managed
   independently, a project's disk allocation will be shared between
   the two systems. Users can follow the exact same directory path on
   each system to access their data.
-  Core-hour usage reporting will be reported separately for each
   system.
-  You do not have to do anything different in regards to MSU's
   Account Management systems. All users have accounts on both
   systems. This is the same for Role accounts.
-  Each NOAA project/group has the exact same user membership on both
   systems.
-  Users have to login (via ssh or putty) to Hercules and Orion
   separately.
-  The ``screen`` command has been replaced with ``tmux``.


**Will Orion's software stack be upgraded to match Hercules?**

Although this is an ongoing discussion between NOAA and MSU, a
decision has not yet been made. There are a lot of different variables
which need to be considered first. The most prudent approach at this
time, is to flush out any issues with the new software stack on
Hercules, allow NOAA projects to port over their workflows and models
to Hercules, let these models and workflows run for a while on
Hercules, and then reevaluate the potential impact of running the new
software stack on Orion. It will also depend greatly on the projected
longevity of the Orion system. Orion runs the CentOS 7.x Operating
System. Vendor support for this OS ends on June 30th, 2024. The OS's
end of vendor support date may drive the need to upgrade Orion to the
new software stack. If this were to happen then multiple user notices
would be sent out over a period of multiple months.

**Should I use the** ``/work`` **or** ``/work2`` **file system for my
project?**

Although all NOAA projects have been provided with a disk allocation
on both file systems, there are some architectural differences between
the two file systems. The ``/work2`` file system has over 2x the
capacity of ``/work``. It also has a Solid State Disk (SSD) storage,
which may improve small file performance and random I/O. We recommend
that you try both file systems and then choose which one works better
for your project.

**How do I use Jupyter Notebooks on Orion?**

Typically, port forwarding is needed to launch and use Jupyter from
the command line. Orion's current security posture does not allow port
forwarding, so the recommended method for using Jupyter on Orion is to
use the interactive Jupyter Notebooks application or the Virtual
Desktop on our Open OnDemand HPC portal.

Implementation of Open OnDemand includes a Jupyter Notebook
interactive server application under the :menuselection:`Interactive
Apps`` dropdown menu. When you select the jupyter notebook
application, on the next page you can enter in Slurm job parameters
then launch the server application on one of the Orion nodes as a job.

MSU has documentation for the Open OnDemand interface.

The OOD jupyter notebook instance is currently launched with the
python/3.7.5 module that is available on Orion. You should be able to
launch custom kernels by placing the kernel specs in
``$HOME/.local/share/jupyter/kernels`` before launching jupyter
notebook with OOD.

**Why am I getting a "segmentation fault occurred" error when I run my
program?**

-  Job crashed due to small stack size (on both Orion and Hercules)

   Although this may be a bug in your code, it is more likely to be a
   stack size issue. Stack space is a segment of program memory that
   is typically used by temporary variables in the program's
   subroutines and functions. Attempting to access a variable that
   resides beyond the stack space boundary will cause segmentation
   faults. The usual remedy is to increase the stack size and re-run
   your program. The soft limit (default) for the stack size on Orion
   and Hercules is set to 16KB. You can set this limit higher by
   running ``ulimit -s <stack_size>`` and then running ``ulimit -s``
   to verify. We recommend that you set this within your batch scripts
   and do not add this to your ``~/.bashrc`` file, as it can cause
   unintended consequences.

-  Job crashed due to out of node memory (on both Orion and Hercules)

   The job crashed for large size and worked for small size. One
   possibility is out of node physical memory. The suggested solution
   is to use more nodes, or run less MPI tasks per node. Make sure
   that the node is not shared with other jobs (``#SBATCH
   --exclusive``). job crashed due to out of MPI buffer size for intel
   compiler

-  Job crashed due to MPI buffer size on Hercules only

   The job crashed for large size and worked for small size. The large
   size worked for a single MPI task and crashed with multiple MPI
   tasks. In intel compiler, the default ``I_MPI_SHM_HEAP_VSIZE`` is
   8192 (unit is MB). Users can redefine this value before ``srun``
   command based on the maximum node memory (not exceeding the maximum
   node memory). When too big, it will have the MPI initialization
   error as: unable to allocate shared memory.

-  ``--ntasks-per-node`` option on Hercules only

   For the large domain, when ``--ntasks-per-node`` has been used, the
   model crashes. Since the hercules has much large memory on each
   node, user does not need to use this option.


**Use modules on Hercules - For WRF model as an example**

Loading modules will provide the defined environment variables.
However the variable name may not be what you used on other machines.
Users should check and make sure. Following is an example when compile
WRF model on Hercules.

-  Netcdf

   The netcdf-c and netcdf-fortran have been installed in different
   directories. After loading the modules, it provides
   ``NETCDF_C_ROOT`` and ``NETCDF_FORTRAN_ROOT``. Users need to copy
   them to the same directory and provide the definition of “NETCDF”
   in order to compile WRF. For example, I create a new directory for
   ``$NETCDF``.

   .. code-block:: shell

      $ cp -r $NETCDF_C_ROOT/\* $NETCDF/.
      $ cp -r NETCDF_FORTRAN_ROOT/\* $NETCDF/.

-  Parallel netcdf

   After loading the module, it provides ``PARALLEL_NETCDF_ROOT``.
   Users need to define “PNETCDF”. For example: ``export
   PNETCDF=$PARALLEL_NETCDF_ROOT``. Otherwise, the WRF model compiles
   successfully. But fails when you use parallel IO (such as set
   ``io_form_input=11`` in ``namelist.input``).
