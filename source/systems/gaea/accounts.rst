CPU allocations on Gaea are defined by the allocation board, with allocations
allotted among different groups and systems. Each of these currently has a
portion of time allocated. Dual running is done within the standard allocations
under a QOS (Quality of Service) tag of "dual." Windfall is a catch-all quality
of service account for users who have exhausted their groups monthly CPU
allocation, or who wish to run without charging to their groups CPU allocation
and forfeit job priority factors.

SLURM is a Resource Manager and Scheduler. For Gaea-specific SLURM information,
see SLURM Tips. For a general introduction to SLURM, see SLURM.
