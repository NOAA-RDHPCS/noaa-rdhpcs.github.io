Getting Access
==============

This figure is an overview of the timeline and process for system access.

Once you have  a NOAA.gov email address, you can request an RDHPCS account.
Visit the `Account Information Management (AIM) website
<https://aim.rdhpcs.noaa.gov>`_ and  request access to the RDHPCS project.  Log
into AIM using your NOAA email credentials, review your profile for accuracy,
and request the RDHPCS project.

Once this request is approved, you will receive an email containing
instructions about your next steps. These include requesting access to
further projects and completing the RSA token request form.  Confer
with your supervisor and colleagues to identify the  project(s) to
request.

RSA Software Token
------------------

RSA software tokens provide two factor authentication (2FA) for NOAA RDHPCS
systems for SSH access. When you’re assigned to your first project, the RSA
token form will be used to assign your software token. Your RSA token will
include instructions about how to initialize it. You can find more information
on RSA tokens here: Logging in - rdhpcs-common-docs (noaa.gov).

.. note::

    If you don’t have a smartphone, you can request an RSA hardware token. RSA software tokens are preferred.

CAC Access
----------

The Common Access Card (CAC), is the preferred means of access to
RDHPCS resources for both Web and SSH access. To obtain a CAC, work
with your local admin services team as they need to start the
application process.  Some labs can issue CACs on-site, otherwise you
will have to visit a RAPIDS site. The site locator website is `ID Card
Office Online <https://idco.dmdc.osd.mil/idco/>`_.  SSH logins
with a CAC require additional software.

Accessing the Systems
=====================

.. note::

    To access a system, you must be on a project assigned to that system.

On-Premise RDHPCS systems (Gaea, Hera, Jet, Niagara, PPAN) are
accessed via SSH. MSU systems (Orion, Hercules) are accessed via SSH
or OpenOnDemand.

Cloud RDHPCS platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP) are accessed via ParallelWorks in a web
browser.  Login to `Parallel Works <https://noaa.parallel.works/login>`_.

Cloud Computing
---------------

The Cloud Platform allows RDHPCS users to create a high-performance
computational cluster on a cloud-based platform (AWS, Azure or GCP)
with resources that are appropriate for specific processing tasks.
Cloud access is mediated through the Parallel Works application. An
overview of the Cloud workflow, and links to detailed instructions,
can be found in the Cloud User Guide.
